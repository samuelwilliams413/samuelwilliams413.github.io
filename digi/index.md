# Notes to Self

# Writing a Jira ticket

- State what you, as the leader, are trying to achieve, and why ('the big picture')
- State what you want the person to achieve
- Define the resources available to the person, and any constraints
- Say how you want progress / issues to be reported

> You don’t define how the person should carry out the task – if they are competent and you trust them, they should be able to figure this out themselves.
