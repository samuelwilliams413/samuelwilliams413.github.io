I'm at day 3 of no stimulants, which for me is the worst. 






As an aside, standard advice given to spergs is that they should just find something that they have in common with other people and just make small talk. I tried this, and every conversation was effort and boring. When I raised this with my more social friends they just gave me the same advice. They seemed incapable of understanding. Once I got a dog, garden, house, and a job this became 3000% easier. Turns out that normal people have lots of common interests with other normal people. I didn't. I would meet people with whom I had nothing in common with and I could not have a standard normal conversation. Once I started doing more normal stuff I found that I could always fall back on my normal stuff. I could make small talk. This is why I recommend taking up one of the most common hobbies.  It will always be a crutch in a bland conversation.
