## Rolling Stats
Stats are generated with `3d6` in the following order Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA).

**How to purchase scrolls: [Scrolls](#scrolls)**

- A dog character weights 5 + their encumbrance

# Magic

## Crafting

All classes may craft magical equipment and items.

- Crafting requires the gold cost up front
- Crafting requires 4 hours for every 100 gp

### Enchanting

Items may be enchanted by any class, you may only enchant spells which you know or have access to (e.g. via spellbook or scroll).

|Type|Cost (gp)|Example|
|:--|--:|:--|
|Single Use|Spell Level * Casting Level * 100|Scroll|
|20 Use|Spell Level * Casting Level * 2000|Wand|
|Command Word (Once per Day)|Spell Level * Casting Level * 3000|Crown of Fireball|

|Grapping Arrow|3| As per grappling hook, non-magical (reusable)|
|Vial Tipped|0.2|Via breaks on hit|

|Hexproof|900|As *Remove Curse*|
|Cheshire's Grin|400|As *Invisibility*|
|Gab|400|As *Beast Tongue*|

|Blade Oil|200|Single Weapons counts as +1 and magical|

## Identifying Items
Items which are magical may have their magical properties identified by careful and focused study. Each night you may study one magical item. You may then roll an intelligence save to identify its properties. There is no guarantee that this process will reveal all magical properties of an item (e.g. if cursed).

You may repeat this process each night.

## Scrolls

A scroll allows a character to cast the spell written on the scroll.

- The scroll disintegrates into a fine ash once the spell is cast.
- Ten scrolls are size 1
- Up to ten scrolls may be stored in a scroll case without taking up additional space.
- Anyone may use a scroll
- A scroll requires a full turn, loud incantations, and two hands to activate.

Cost of Scroll: Spell Level^2 * 100

> e.g. Scroll of Fireball > 3rd level spell = `3*3*100 = 900 gp`

## Faith
[Religion is handled on a seperate page](https://gist.github.com/samuelwilliams413/8b3ed0bc37ef29c8726fb9c72c1e3381)

# Combat
## Initiative
To determine who acts in what order, at the start of combat each side rolls a d6. Whoever rolls highest gos first. Sides take turns.

- If one side is surpised they go second.
- If one side has a better change to go first they may roll muliple d6 and chose the highest.
- Characters on each side act in any order within their turn.

## Dual Wielding
You may wield two weapons at the same time:

- Both weapons must be one handed.
- Every time you would normally be able to attack you may attack with each weapon.
- Both weapon's attack die is reduced by 1 (```d12>d10>d8>d6>d4>1```)

## Two handed weapons
You may wield a weapon with two hands:

- Weapon must be two handed.
- When you deal damage, deal bonus damage equal to your total number of attacks per round. E.g L3 Warrior = 1d8 + 3

## Sword and Board
You may wield a shield and 1 handed weapon at the same time:

- Shields provide AP as normal
- Shield provide damage reduction. When you take damage reduce tha mount take by your current damage reduction.
- You may not deal damage with a shield.


## Ranged Combat

### Firing into melee

When firing into a melee that includes allies; roll to hit normally, but if you miss the attack resolves against a random ally (ally rolls DEX check to avoid damage normally).

### Thown weapons

Thrown weapons may be used normally when *close* to an enemy. STR or DEX may be used to attack an enemy if they are *close* or *nearby*.

### Archery

Crossbows and Bows may be used with disadvantage when *close* to an enemy. DEX may be used to attack an enemy if they are *nearby* or *far away*.

A crossbow may be fired with one hand but requires two hands to load.

## Two Handed Spears

Two handed spears function differently from normal 2 handed weapons. Instead, when standing behind an ally you may attack an enemy immediately in front of that ally.


# Miscellaneous

## Experience

Treasure, loot, and wealth are how you gain experience. **For every gold piece of wealth you gain 1 xp.**

|Level|Experience Requirement|
|-----------:|:-----------|
|1|1,000|
|2|2,000|
|3|4,000|
|4|8,000|
|5|16,000|
|Higher|x2 Previous|

*Characters start at level 1*

This is the primary method for gaining XP in the game. However, not all monetary gains are counted as “treasure.” The following may gain the characters wealth, but they **do not count** for XP purposes.

- Coins looted from bodies outside of adventure locations
- Rewards
- Selling magical items that have been used by a PC or retainer
- Tax income
- Theft of wealth from mundane merchants, rulers, and citizens
- Trade, commerce, and other business activity (including selling of mundane items stripped from foes)


The following treasures **do count** for XP purposes:

- All valuable objects recovered from uncivilised or abandoned areas
- Money hoarded by creatures who have no actual use of it

Treasure is calculated for XP only after it has been returned to a secure location.

## Inheritance
A player can at any time have his character create a will in order to pass on his wealth to a new PC after the current one's death.
If doing so, he must specify the name, relationship, and character class of the PC who stands to inherit. After his current PC dies, he takes on the heir and then rolls up the stats and hit points.

>The idea is to create a trade-off between being able to pass on money but potentially being stuck with a sub-optimal weak fighter or stupid magic-user next time around.
> - Sam

## Hirelings

Hirelings may be hired for a deposit (14 days wages) and a daily wage. They must be provided with rations and accommodation.
Hirelings when harmed or asked to do something dangerous roll on their loyalty die. When their loyalty die is exhausted (1 or 2 on 1d4) they rout.

- A CHA save may be made (by the employer) to reroll a loyalty die.
- You may employ a maximum number of hirelings equal to half your HD (round down). Each time a hireling dies, the reputational damage reduces this number by 1.
- Hireling stats are 8 unless otherwise specified.

|Wage|HD (HP)|Type|Loyalty|Equipment|Notes|
|:-:|:---:|:----|:---:|:----|:----|
|1|1 (5)|Porter & Lantern Bearer|d6|Backpack, Large Sack, Common Clothes, Lantern, 2 Flasks of Lamp Oil|STR 13 (total capacity = 10)|
|4|1 (5)|Scholar|d6|Backpack, Common Robes, Priest's tools|Can read one extra language (Giant, Barbar, Umbra, Nagan)|


## Miscellaneous Miscellaneous
## Animal Training

If you have tamed an animal you may attempt to train it. For every 1000xp that your character gains they can attempt to teach an animal 1 new trick. Roll a wisdom check, on a pass pick one trick to add to your pets repertoire.

- Stay, Heel
- Follow, Come
- Go (Point)
- Go Home
- Attack
- Flee
- Hide, Quiet
- Fetch, Drop

## Water
When swimming the following rules apply:

- You sink if your encumbrance is more than half your strength (rounded down).
- The range of projectiles is reduced to _close_.

When underwater the following rules apply:

- Your breath is represented by a d8 Usage die
- Each turn you are underwater and each time may take an action you roll on your breath die.
	- This means that each turn you take actions underwater (e.g. moving, searching, fighting) you must roll twice.
- Casting a spell underwater requires you to speak loudly. This immediately causes you to fail a breath die check (reduce breath die e.g. d8 to d6).
- When your breath die is exhausted (1 or 2 on 1d4) you fall unconscious.
	- For each turn that your character remains unconscious roll for [Brain Damage](#brain-damage)

> Try not to fall unconscious underwater
> - Sam

### Storage
If you have items which you which to keep securely you may store them in town (Snorri). A trunk (size 10) in the local tavern may be hired for 1gp a week.

### Brain Damage
Roll `1d6`

|Roll|Outcome|
|---:|:---|
|1|Permanently reduce INT by 6|
|2|Permanently reduce WIS by 6|
|3|Permanently reduce CHA by 6|
|4|Permanently reduce DEX by 6|
|5|Permanently lose 1 level|
|6|Instant Death|

If your character is reduced to less than 0 experience or level 1 your character dies and you reroll immediately.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

### Banes and Boons

> We are not using these rules.
> - Sam

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have a bane or boon on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. Positive circumstances grant one or more **boons**. Negative circumstances impose one or more **banes**.

When making a check, for each boon roll a d6 and then **add** the highest number rolled on *all* the dice to the d20 roll. Banes function like boons, however the result is **subtracted** from your score. Boons and banes cancel each out, one for one. For example, if you have 3 boons and 2 banes, you would roll 1 boon (2 boons cancel 2 banes).

For example, assume that your dexterity is 15, if you were to make a dexterity check (d20 roll) with 3 boons you would roll 1d20 and 3d6. Say you get 15 and 1,4,6. The highest number is 6, so you would add 6 ro your dexterity, making it 21 and an easy pass. If, instead you had 3 banes, you would subtract 6 (the highest result) from your dexterity, making it 9 and failing the check.

If you have excess gold you can invest in a Dragon Fund. You may invest your funds at any point when you are in Snorri. Each session that you do not make any gold withdrawls (not including the session that you first deposit funds) the value of you investment increases by 5%. If you wish to withdrawl gold you may only do so at the *beginning* of a session.
