# Wilderness

> Healthy characters may walk for 6 points worth of moment per day (approximately 2 hours). In real life, people can travel farther in a given time limit across clear terrain than across mountains, rough terrain, swamps, etc. This is reflected in the game. 

> For example, since it only costs one movement point to enter a Clear terrain hex, you could move your Person Counter 6 hexes in one turn as long as all 6 hexes were Clear terrain hexes. On the other hand, since it costs 2 movement points to enter a Woods/Rough hex, you could only move a total of 3 hexes per turn through Woods/Rough terrain. 

> You may move through any combination of varying terrain in one turn providing you have the proper number of movement points to spend. For example, you could spend your 6 movement points by entering a Clear terrain hex, (1), then a River hex (3), then another Clear terrain hex (1), and then a Ford hex (1). Suppose, however, that the final move would take you into a Woods/Rough hex instead of a Ford hex; you would not be allowed to enter the Woods/Rough hex because it requires 2 movement points which you did not have left to spend. Thus you would only be able to spend 5 movement points in this particular turn. Unused movement points cannot be accumulated and used on later turns. 

> It costs you 3 movement points to enter a river hex, regardless of whether you are crossing the river or traveling along the river. You may, however, negate this cost by crossing a river at a ford in which event it only costs you 1 movement point.

At the end of each session the party will be teleported back to Snorri.

||Clear|Woods|River|Swamp|Mtns|Desert|Ford|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Cost (pts)|1|2|Min 3|4|3|2|1|
|Encounter Chance|6|5|5|4|4|5|5|
|Lost Chance|6|5|6|4|5|4|-|
|Overt|3|4|6|5|5|6|6|
|Hidden (1pt to search)|6|5|3|3|4|6|3|

- Trails reduce movement cost by 1 (to a minimum of 1)
- Wilderness chances are rolled on a d6.
- The party navigator may elect to roll a WIS check with disadvantage to not get lost.

## Weather

- The party elects one player to roll 3d6
- Weather remains for d6 days

|#|Weather|Effect|
|-:|:-|:-|
|3-4|Tornados|Vortex|
|5-8|Clear|None|
|9-10|Partly Cloudy|None|
|11-12|Light Showers|Wet|
|13-14|Raining|Wet, Drenched|
|15-16|Thunderstorm|Wet, Drenched, Lightning|
|17-18|Hailstorm|Wet, Drenched, Hail|

- `Wet`= Pourous equipment (e.g. paper) may become damage. Exposed flames extinguished.
- `Drenched`= All Movement Costs increased by 1. River and ford crossing are unsafe. Disadvantage on DEX checks relating to wet surfaces. 
- `Hail`= 1d6 damage for each movement point spent. 
- `Lightning`= 5% chance (1d20) of being struck by lightning (10d6) for each movement point spent. Disadvantage if in mountain terrain. 
- `Vortex`= 5% chance (1d20) of being swept up and blown away (death) for each movement point spent. Disadvantage if in clear terrain.

# Camping

- Each person needs to sleep six hrs
- Night goes for nine hours (I may make this seasonal)
- Twice a night I'll roll to see if there is a random encounter (based on terrain type)

To find a camp ground roll 4d6 in order for the following:

- Levelness of site
- Number of entrances
- Privacy
- Shelter

Then roll a wisdom check, on a pass you may roll an additional d6 and swap one result.

> E.g. Alice and bob decide that they want to make camp. Bobs rolls 4d6 [1,2,5,6] Alice rolls 4d6 [6,4,5,1]

> Bob fails his WIS check. Alice passes hers, rolls an additional d6 (2) and swaps it for one of her results [2,4,3,1]

> Based on these results the party has can camp in: Bob's campground (Outwards Slope, One entrance, Exposed and Conspicuous location) or Alice's campground (Outwards Slope, Two entrances, Plain and Covered location)

## Levelness
_Effects projectiles in a possible encounter_

|#|Result|Effect|
|-:|:-|:-|
|1-2|Outwards Slope|Adv. to dodge ranged attacks|
|3-4|Flat Ground|None|
|5-6|Inwards Slope|Dis. to dodge ranged attacks|

> In choosing the site for a camp, the best one is a flat tabletop, with ground sloping away in all directions towards the enemy. The sentries should be posted hidden, so as just to see over the edge. With this arrangement, should the enemy possess arms of precision and small guns, it is difficult for him to fire into camp, for he must aim to clear the edge of the table-land, and then the shot goes high.
> - General Sir William C.G. Heneker,  Bush Warfare

## Entrances
_Effects movement in a possible encounter_

|#|Result|
|-:|:-|
|1-2|One entrance|
|3-4|Two entrances|
|5-6|Three entrances|

## Privacy
_Effects likelihood of possible encounter_

|#|Result|Effect|
|-:|:-|:-|
|1-2|Hidden|-1 to encounter chance|
|3-4|Plain|None|
|5-6|Conspicuous|+1 to encounter chance|

## Shelter
_Effects kind of possible encounter and weather_

|#|Result|Effect|
|-:|:-|:-|
|1-2|Covered|Ignore effects of weather|
|3-4|Partial Cover|Ignore damage effects of weather|
|5-6|Exposed|+1 to encounter roll|

# Watch

> E.g. Twice a night I will roll 1d6 to determine if there is an encounter, then 1d9 (1d10 rerolling 10s) to determine when there is an encounter, and finally 2d20 (adv) to determine what you encounter

- `W` = On Watch (can read, stand, study, appraise)
- `S` = Sleeping (no longer wearing armour, initiative 1)
