# Obtain Gf

I'm happily married with a white picket fence, two dogs, and a baby on the way. My wife and I are happy, don't fight, have frequent satisfying sex, and enjoy each others company. I grew up not knowing how to find a partner and never saw positive fulfilling relationships. For posterity I thought it wise to write something for a future son.

Firstly, I'm unable to really give any advice on short-term relationships. I've never really had any so I don't have much to say. There are other people better suited to that. Instead, I'll give advice on finding a long term romantic partner with the intention of a life long relationship.

I think I'll write something later about why I think long-term relationships are the best course of action, but for now, let's treat this as a given.

I'm tempted to use the analogy of catching a fish for the various stages. Partially because it maps well, but also because I'm familiar with the process. However, my reservations are that you might get the wrong impression regarding how passive finding a partner is. Fishing is passive, or at least getting a bite is, which does not represent finding a partner. I can't think of anything better so I think we'll stick with that.

So in fishing, you basically have 4 distinct stages. The order also is the importance and size of the stage.
 1.	  Preparing the tackle and baiting the hook.
 2.	 Casting the hook.
 3.	 Reeling the fish in.
 4.	 Dressing the fish (gutting the fucker).

## Baiting the hook
So when you fish you basically have three bits of kit. A medium to entice (the bait), a medium to retain (the hook), and a medium to crystallize the bite (the line/reel). As a potential partner, you basically want the same. You need to be the kind of person who not only isn't dismissed but is actively considered as a partner (the bait). You need to be the kind of person worth seeing more than once who someone might actually want to be with (after making a first impression), this is the hook. And lastly, you need to be able to turn short term into long term (reel 'em in).

Female desire is more complicated, but also more forgiving than male desire. The general paradigm for a good long term partner for a woman (and this is what they select for) is someone who would make a good husband during pregnancy and a good father (especially during the first 5-10 years). What makes this forgiving (but not lenient) is that almost all of this you can control and you're not hamstrung by age as much.

I'll talk more about male desire in the "casting the hook stage".

In cross-cultural studies, women all find the following traits strongly attractive (not in order):
  -	 Devotion
  -	 Loyalty and fidelity
  -	 Strength and physical health
  -	 Status, power, esteem, and respect
  -	 Kindness, compassion, gentleness
  -	 Industriousness
  -	 Stability and sincerity
  -	 Resources, specifically being willing and able to provide

This boils down to two expectations. A man will be committed and provide.

By committed it is meant that a partner should be solely devoted to their single partner. Their behavior should reflect this. They should not flirt with other women. They should not text their exes. They should proactively seek commitment and affirm their intentions. It should be abundantly clear that they are committed to their wife and that they expect their wife to be committed to them. This is where healthy possessiveness and jealousy can be beneficial. This is why women like to wear men's clothes. To be claimed. A woman wants to feel like she is his, and that he wants her and no one else. A significant and common component of female fantasies and arousal is that they want to be wanted. The epitome of this, and the female power fantasy, is to be so attractive that the man (or men) who are normally rational are reduced to bestial desires by her beauty.

She should know as strongly evidenced by your words and deeds (and not contradicted) that you are her priority, you are here for the long haul, and that you are not making side bets.

Providing means that as an individual you have the capacity to fulfill your family's needs. You can get more if you need to. If problems or dangers occur you can resolve them. That no matter what comes you will be willing and able to provide for your family's needs. This means that you need to have and be able to generate money. You need to be fiscally capable. You need to be healthy. You need to be able to build friendships and connections. You need to be able to persevere. You must be clever and wise. And above all, what you have you must be willing to give her. If your baby boy is cold, you must be able to make him warm. If your pregnant wife is hungry you must be able to feed her. Etc.

Although it is possibly simpler to conceptualize it like this: women want a man who adores and cherishes their partner. Who has no inclination to leave her or stray. Who is sensitive and accommodating to her needs without slavish desperation. A man who will aggressively pursue the things his family needs and provide the things he has without reservation. A man who by *all* metrics is capable and is acknowledged as such.

If you remove behaviors that you have that disintegrate relationships (e.g. addiction) and you are able to maintain a job, multiple social circles, cherish a woman, and not be pathetic, then you will be able to find someone willing to date you. Everything else you do on top will simply improve the range of potential partners available to you.

**Things to do (everything here should be bold):**
  -	 Get a fucking job, keep it, and look for ways to improve upon it. She should be able to tell that you are hustling.
  -	 Involve yourself in social groups and be a person who is respected and held in esteem. Multiple circles with different interests and age groups.
  -	 Provide her with the things that she considers valuable (time, gifts, attention, support).
  -	 Proactively affirm your commitment and long term intentions. This is incredibly important.
  -	 Be intelligent with your money, be frugal and have a plan, but be recklessly generous and charitable with her.
  -	 Whenever you encounter a small child or animal practice being a father. Be a good father to them.
  -	 Stop getting other people to do things you should know how to do, instead if something happens and you don't know how to solve it get help and learn.
  -	 Maintain your health.
  -	 Learn and grow, develop capacity, do anything to be more capable. If you have lots of spare time filled with dead unfulfilling entertainment, then google the 10 most popular hobbies and do one of them.
  -	 Sincerity is attractive, if you believe in something you should act like it. This means going to church

## Casting the hook
Once you're dateable you need to meet women. You also need to be meeting the right kind of women. This is where my standard advice probably differs from standard dating advice the most. The standard advice for men is about creating short term sexual encounters. Dudes want to fuck, so that's what sells.

If you want to have casual sex you'll get recommendations to effectively cold call women. Approach people, make conversation, head to places where singles hang out. Y'know coffee shops, bars, clubs, the gym, yoga, basically wherever a woman might be. You don't need to know them just say hello. And this is all well and good for casual encounters.

For longer-term encounters, you're looking for *a woman that you actually like* (not required for casual sex). You're also looking for a woman who's going to commit to you and has similar values to you. So how do you find such a magical woman? Through existing contacts.

Finding women through the people you know is a fantastic way of doing preliminary vetting of that individual. It's a fantastic way of learning their opinions and values, simply by talking to their peers. In fact, you can learn 90% of what someone considers within the acceptable range of opinions by hanging out with their friends. And guess what, if they're in the same circles as you then they're already very likely to tolerate or embrace what you believe.

So what kinds of events am I talking about? Church, professional mixers, family and community gatherings (no incest), balls and events planned by organizations that you're part of, parties with friends,  every and any event hosted by small local businesses or community groups, etc. A rule of thumb: anywhere that you can know the girl's name before you meet her (introduction, name tag, reputation). If you're going to something like a bar or a museum or a venue then smaller more specialized gigs are the way to go.

So, as an example, let's say that you're a young Christian male looking for waifu material. Get involved in the smaller groups, help out with set up and teardown, volunteer for all the events or drives, do the aside charity stuff, make friends, hang out with their friends, and always put your best foot forward. You'll meet dozens if not hundreds of new people (women!). These people might become friends, might be dateable, and might be able to introduce you to someone they know. You honestly can not expect to find compatible women when you haven't met any new women since high school. You can't expect to walk into a room of 50 and find "her" there. You need to throw your bait in with the fish, and if there are no bites move to the next fishing spot.

If you do this for 6 months, I guarantee that you will meet multiple women who you will consider dateable.

A brief note on male sexuality. Males screen for fertility (fuckability), fidelity (whoreishness), and compatibility (in order). Everything else is secondary. You are not going to be attracted to someone much older than yourself. You are not going to be attracted (i.e. wanting to be chained to) a known thot. You are not going to want to spend time with someone you can't stand (excluding the desire for casual sex). Aside from treating multiple previous sexual partners, non-monogamy, and infidelity as the gigantic red flags, I'm not concerned about you being attracted to someone "bad".

**Things to do**
  -	 Through your multiple social groups (of varying interests, ages, and genders) be as socially engaged and involved as you can stand. Meet new people.
  -	 Don't try and pick up, be friendly to everyone you meet. Be your best self and remain vigilant.
  -	 Assume that women being nice to you is not an expression of attraction. She's just being nice. For now, no exceptions.

## Reeling them in
So at this point, you've been meeting and talking to people for a while now. You should be comfortable talking to people of most stripes. This will probably include pretty girls. As you talk to people more, your familiarity will relieve some of the anxiety.

Eventually, you will meet a woman worth talking to. And not in the horny sense. The conversation is enough, not because it's human contact and you're horribly alone, but because they think in a way that rewards your attention. If this woman is attracted to you then you've got a potential lead.

Now is a good time for an aside on the difference between interests, opinions, and values. Interests are the surface levels things that you and your partner like and dislike. What's your favorite color, do you like pizza, do you like to travel? Opinions are the conclusions that you've drawn. Do you want kids, do you work out, how do you dress? And values are the subconscious currents that guide your decisions. Do you need to control things, is status more important than virtue, how do you deal with conflict? Values create opinions which create interests. In one sense it's fair to say that people with similar interests will probably have similar opinions and values. However, this is not normally entirely accurate. For example, someone might despises Pakistan because they're a feminist and the culture treats women poorly, someone else might hate Pakistan because they're racist. In this hypothetical, both partners dislike Pakistan (opinion). They both might reject Pakistani food, or aesthetics, or distrust people from Pakistan, or prefer people from Sweden (interests). However, just because these people seem like they have lots in common doesn't mean they do - they actually don't. They're temporarily aligned, they actually don't have a shared and common will. They might bond over the fact that they dislike similar things and like similar things, but when it comes to raising their children and one wants to raise them as a feminist and the other wants to raise their child as a crusader there will be conflict. All this is to say, just because a 10 point questionnaire says that you align on a bunch of stuff does not mean that you're actually alike or compatible.

The woman that you are talking to will have similar interests to you. If you met through existing social circles then you should have similar opinions. The next step in the process is finding out if you have similar values. This is the part that I can't script for you. This is the part that requires the most self-awareness.

You need to know what you want to commit to before you can discern for it in women. Consider the kind of life that you would find desirable. Not just in the broad white-picket-fence sense. But in great detail. How would you like to spend your weekends? What would you like to read on the train to work? Do you want to commute? Do you want kids? Did you want to homeschool them? Did you want to retire at 40 or travel? Think about how you would spend your time if you were with your imaginary waifu every hour of the day.

Once you've got a good idea of an image, begin breaking it down into the underlying forces that guided the image. Use this to create a series of guiding values that you believe inform the things you value. When you are talking to this girl follow a similar approach. You should be able to build a mental map of each of your values and how they align. Don't force it, as the conversation steers in one direction or another gently ask why she feels that way about whatever you are talking about. Also, fully expect her to not be able to articulate her values,

I personally love to be *fatherly* or *patriarchal*. I like helping little dumpy things do stuff. I like caring for them. I have great patience for them. I like watching them struggle and succeed. I can comfortably watch someone do something poorly and not intervene. But what this tells me is that I'm the kind of person who would enjoy having a dog, cat, foster-child, or lots of nieces and nephews. This means that when a potential partner tells me that her family does animal rescue for old racing horses I can say with some level of confidence that there is a potential dream life where I am involved with what that family does. If a potential partner however tells me that she wants to travel, doesn't like pets, and wants to be free to do archaeology in the middle of the desert (as exciting as it sounds) I'm probably not going to be fulfilled, long term, in that relationship (unless there is something auxiliary that scratches the itch).

**This entire approach depends on you *knowing* that there are many women, that being in a bad relationship is worse than being single, and you don't have to lock down the first girl that's fun.**

The ideal relationship is not one where you can think for each other. The ideal relationship is one where in two persons have a singular will. Rather than having to compromise or accommodate each other, in the ideal relationship, the thing you want is the thing she wants. Obviously, this is impossible for all things at all times. But the closer you are the better.

If you are frugal then finding someone who is frugal will result in a more harmonious marriage. Agreeing on how to use your money is the best way to not argue about how you spend your money *(a top cause of divorce)*. Knowing what your partner likes and being able to order food for them without asking is good, but being able to order for both of you and share is better. However, you can only find this and filter for the opposite by asking the kinds of questions that reveal the values that inform decisions and opinions.

If a woman doesn't spend much money on clothes, but she's also a poor university student then her current behavior doesn't actually tell you that much. When she finally gets some cash she might want to splurge. Understanding the values that drive her decisions is essential. Because while your current material circumstances might result in the two of you having identical opinions on when to order takeout, changes to your material circumstances might change a previously harmonious relationship.

I've really belabored this one point but that's because besides being a desirable person in general (step one) this is the most important thing you can do to ensure success. Find someone who wants the same things as you. If you fell into a 12-month coma, your partner should be able to handle your affairs in a manner that you approve of. You should know that when unattended or behind closed doors she's teaching your children the things that you both believe in. If this is true for you, then it will be true in reverse.

Absent from this entire process are tips to make her like you. Or get her to put out. Or to trick her. Or even how to talk to her. Because that won't be needed. You don't need to figure out a pickup line, because she's not some stranger at a bar. You don't need to convince her you're a stud, because you've already made yourself fundamentally acceptable and lovable. You don't need conversation points because you're genuinely trying to understand her. You don't need tips to stay awake because you're only talking to women who you enjoy talking to.  You don't need to trick her to remain interested because you're talking about the things that the two of you are interested in. You've got time to be with each other. You don't need to make up an excuse to continue hanging out. L33t hax. If you do this long enough then biology will take over and you'll both be magnetically drawn into each other's lives.

**Things to do**
  -	 Understand your own values and the criteria by which you make decisions. Do some soul searching and figure out what you could swear a life-long oath to living.
  -	 Through the course of normal conversation with an attractive woman try and understand the values that fuel her actions. **Stop pursuing women whose values are incompatible with yours.**
  -	 Figure out how she expresses love, affection, and gratitude. Figure out how she likes love, affection and gratitude expressed to her. This will make being nice to her much easier.

## Dressing & Gutting
At this stage, you've got a girl in your life who you can't stop thinking about. She's sexy and fun. You like talking to her and she wants the same things in life (kids, marriage, work life). The two of you are probably spending more and more time together. You're both looking for excuses to be around each other. You might even be hanging out alone. You're probably talking or messaging like crazy.

At this point, you as a man have a responsibility. It is your role to proactively declare that:
  -	 You have romantic feelings for her.
  -	 You want to be in a monogamous relationship with her.
That's it. You don't need to tell her you want to fuck, or get married, or that you exclusively beat off to her, or that you want to have babies with her, or anything else. Just those two things. If she asks questions then answer them. But above all else: unambiguously communicate your committed intention to be with her.

That's it. That's as far as I can take you. You have a girlfriend. A girlfriend with whom you can build the life you dreamt of. I might write something later about maintaining a relationship, sex, and all the other stuff but that's not really part of this. I'm quite confident that every stage after this one will flow naturally as long as you follow the guidelines given here. Don't stop being committed, or proactive, or dateable, or a provider and it should all go fine (assuming that you picked a good one).

"But wait," you say, "what if she doesn't like me," you say, "what if she's shit," you say. We'll here be a checklist of things to look out for to verify if she actually likes you and isn't' just being agreeable. If you have a majority of yeses then you can rest easy.

  -	 Does she actively try to spend more time with you?
  -	 Does she laugh at low-tier jokes that you make?
  -	 Does she stare at you?
  -	 Does she touch you or move closer to you than other people in her life?
  -	 Does her desire to talk/hang with you result in disruptions to her standard behaviors. E.g. Does she lose sleep talking to you late at night? Does she leave 1 minute later than normal when catching the bus? Does she stay out later than normal because you're around?
  -	 Have her friends developed a probing interest in you?
  -	 Has she invited you to gatherings with family and friends?
  -	 Does she ask you questions about relationships, what you want from life? (e.g. questions that indirectly ask if you will make a good husband)
  -	 Does she make exceptions to the rule (and boundaries established with other male friends) for you?
  -	 Does she feel like she can be vulnerable with you? Has she demonstrated vulnerability or dependence on you? (e.g. when something breaks or she's stuck out in the rain?)

Additionally here's a list of common pitfalls you might encounter Each of them has been the root cause of relationship failures of mine.
  -	 **Reciprocating affection**: When you're incredibly lonely and touch-starved, it can be tempting to take what you can get. Or fixate on what's available. When I was younger and driven by a mentality of "I'll never have a gf" I entered a relationship in part because affection was reciprocated. It can be incredibly tempting to enter a relationship when one presents itself. But this is not a solid foundation. Don't get me wrong, not being wanted is a deal breaker, but being wanted is absolutely not a deal maker.
  -	 **Not seeking what you want**: This ties into reciprocating affection, but it's very easy to not consider what you actually want and go along with a potential mate's desires. Many men don't consider what they want long term so they're barely even aware when there is a conflict. The problems here are twofold and I encountered both in a previous relationship. Firstly, even if you do want something that your partner want, neither you nor them will be certain of it. You'll find yourself trying to convince her that something is what you want instead of you just going along with them. Secondly, you might find yourself wanting things they don't want. Things that you can not compromise on (e.g. children). Regardless of how swell a girl is, you don't want to be left trapped in a relationship resenting her for all the things you missed out on.
  -	 **Assessing based on interests, not values**: Similar to the previous two, this occurs when you're acting from a mentality of scarcity and haste. If you're not getting to know someone before committing to them then you've made a big mistake. If you've committed to someone but never asked discerning questions that is just as bad. Everything I've said before applies here, but I just want to underscore how easy it is to deceive yourself. I've lied to myself and seen others lie to themselves by emphasizing trivial similarities while neglecting the glaring differences in paradigms between them and their partner.

Finally, you might find yourself uncertain and unsure of how to proceed. I have two strategies to offer. The first is the simplest I call it a minimal facts approach. Essentially, what are the minimal facts that I would need to make a decision, or more accurately what additional information would change my mind? For a girl, it could be a question of whether or not she is right for you. In this case, you basically need to know if 1) she's going to cheat 2) if you think she's pretty 3) if the happiness that you feel together is sustainable long term. 2 should be easy to answer. 1 and 3 are harder. The information you need to make an assessment is fairly straightforward, and while you can never be certain of the future you can have a strong enough conviction to make a bet. For cheating just find out how promiscuous she, her friends, and her family has been in the past. Find out how many close and intimate male friends she keeps. Find out if she is "easy" or crumbles under pressure. If there's no cheating in her past and she keeps appropriate boundaries then she's probably reliable. Given means and opportunity, you should trust her character enough to know that she won't cheat. The same thing with happiness: of the predictable future changes that both of you will go through is there anything that will result in her being resentful and unhappy? Are there any current rising tensions that you can't resolve? If there is nothing that's causing friction and the future sounds swell then you're probably going to be alright. This does depend on you wanting similar or compatible life paths.

The second tool is the "Tit razor". You've got a girl, she seems swell, there's literally nothing wrong with her, but you're still not sure if she's the one. Basically, it boils down to "Do I really love her, if I would love a clone of her with bigger tits?" And the answer is yes. The fact that someone better may exist does not preclude you from earnestly committing to someone. You shouldn't leave your partner or cheat on them because someone with bigger tits comes around. And you shouldn't abandon your current potential partner for a big tiddy phantom that might exist somewhere in the cosmos.
