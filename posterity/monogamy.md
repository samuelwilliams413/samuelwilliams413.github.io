# Monogamy

I was recently asked by a friend who has minimal dating experience whether or not they should pursue short-term, long-term or a mix of relationships.

I know that there is a [wealth of information and books](http://libgen.gs/ads.php?md5=ffbfc0547e589412eba76949d6b32975) that point to better outcomes for men and women who get married. However, in our culture there are a few reasonable hang ups that are worth exploring.

- The horrors of divorce
- The horrors of marriage
- The desire to sow your wild oats?
- Whats the point of it any way?

I started to write something longer, let me know if I should, but I ended up deleteing everything. Its all pretty straighforward:

- Divorce is exceedinly rare for smart, religious, church going, non-bastard-having, low body count marriages. Its a concern for different people and you can avoid it if you make the right decisions. 
- The same can be said for sad sexless resentful marriages. You can chose to live in a way which leads to a long term relationship where you are respected.
- Probably the most difficult and i'll deal with in its own time. 




## The horrors of divorce
Its really quite easy to find a horror story from some helpless sap who has been arse raped by a lawyer and is now paying their alimony in blood and tears. Its truely horrific. I don't know if I can actually make things any better or disuade you of any fears. But what I can say is that divorce amoung the right people is exceedingly rare. Divorce is like plastic surgury. I've gone my whole life without seeing much of it, but in certain communities a little botox or a nose job are common and standard. Divorce is contagious. Seriouslyt google it. Being around divorced people, seeing divorce, growing up in a divorce makes ypou more likely to divorce. Promiscous people get divoirced more often. Adulterers, adicts, liars, and thieves get divorcede more often. Materialists and normies get divorced more often. But commited relationships where both partners obstained from sex, weren't whores before hand, didn't cheat, didn't have a bastard, who make a public declaration in a strong community, and who attend church almost never ever get divorced.

Thats all the concilation taht I can offer. That if you're doing it right it won't happen to you. **(is this victim blaming?)*


## The horrors of marriage

There's a fear that in the context of a long term relationship that ypu'll end up sexless, resented, tired, and hauinted. We've all seen the guy.
