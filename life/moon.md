### Penguin
[Blue Penguin Colony](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-zealand/oamaru/attractions/blue-penguin-colony/a/poi-sig/1199723/362686)

- General admission will give you a good view of the action but the premium stand (adult/child $45/22.50), accessed by a boardwalk through the nesting area, will get you closer.
- You’ll see the most penguins (up to 250) in November and December.
- they arrive in groups called rafts just before dark (around 5.30pm in midwinter and 9.30pm midsummer), and it takes about an hour for them all to come ashore
- take the daytime behind-the-scenes tour (adult/child self-guided $10/5 or guided $16/8)

- In order to protect these endangered birds, the beach is closed to people from 3pm onwards, but there are hides set up on the cliffs (you'll need binoculars for a decent view). The best time to see them is two hours before sunset.

- Consisting of only a couple of blocks centred on Harbour and Tyne Sts, this atmospheric enclave has some of NZ’s best-preserved Victorian commercial buildings
- At night there are some cute little bars, and you might even see a penguin swaggering along the street – we did!
- The precinct is at its liveliest on **Sundays** when the excellent **Oamaru farmers market** is in full swing.
