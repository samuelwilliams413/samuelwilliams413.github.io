## Rules

### Resolution

DM will specify an atrribute and a threshold (4+, 5+, 6+). Roll the associated number of dice. If any dice are equal to or above the threshold you pass. You can chose to roll less dice.

### Secret Action

During your turn you can in secret write down an action and its conditions. Publicly declare that you are making a secret action, and specify a dice pool. This pool is a penalty to all public rolls, and determines the maximum number of dice that may be used for secret actions. If the secret action is triggered before your next turn reveal and resolve it.

> E.g. I publicly say that I am aiming for the baddie. In secret I say "IF i miss THEN I'm actually aiming for the fuel line behind them". I specify a dice penalty of 3. I intentionally roll fewer dice than normal (to ensure I miss), and then with a match ready reveal my secret action in my next turn.

### Help

If you wish to work with an ally roll all of your dice together. But for every ally an extra success is required.

### Reaction

Outside of your turn you may take one small action. Examples include: 5ft step, drop an item, press a button.
