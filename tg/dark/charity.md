Charity, Nebraska
## Character creation

1. Decide who in Charity you are
1. Chose a name and concept
2. Chose a occupation
3. Describe yourself

## Acting

For a given task

- Roll one die for humanity if task is humanly possible
- Roll one die for Virtue if the task is related to your occupation
- Roll one die for Temptation if you will risk your humanity

Your highest die shows how well you do.

- On a 1, you barely succeed.
- On a 4, you succeed competently.
- On a 6, you succeed brilliantly and get something extra, but maybe more than you wanted.

If your Temptation die was the highest, roll a humanity check. You may always roll a Temptation die. You may always attempt a task again, if you roll a Temptation die as part of the attempt.

### Failure

If meaningful failure is possible roll a a failure die. If the failure die is higher than the highest die for a task, the task fails.

### Fighting

If you try to defeat any supernatural creature by fighting it, you will die. Instead, roll to hide or escape.

### Temptation & Humanity

Humanity starts at 5. 

To roll a humanity check, roll a d6. If the result is equal to or greater than your humanity, reduce your humanity by 1.

If you humanity is equal to 1 your character 'falls', unable to conitnue the fight. Retire the character.
