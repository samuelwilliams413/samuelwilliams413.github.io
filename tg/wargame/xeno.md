Tool Kit

A small set of screwdrivers, wrenches, wire and other items for maintenance and routine repairs, tool kits often contain rolls of “mud tape” (named as it sticks to everything and never comes off ) and a small multi-purpose axe as well.

Calixis Survival Kit

One of the most basic pieces of gear any traveller should have, a survival kit contains a wide variety of equipment and supplies, all of which are intended to help their users survive in less than optimal conditions. Generally, if the owner of a survival kit is forced to rely upon their kit’s contents, something has gone wrong—a particularly deadly prospect on an alien world. Several trade guilds within the Calixis Sector manufacture portable survival kits, with the ones produced by Haal-Lorden of Cantus particularly favoured, as that guild has held a contract to produce kits for the Imperial Guard for several centuries. There are many variants to be had and well-travelled users frequently tailor their personal survival kits to the specific environments they intend to find themselves within. A typical kit includes: two blade razors, an igniter, a Helite flexible wire saw, 14 multi-shape fishing hooks, five press weight lures, 25 metres of heavy fishing line, 1 very large hook, 10-metres brass snare wire, 1 highpowered pocket illuminator, one calibrated button compass with a Calixis Sector world specific guide page, four doses of stimm, six Alozith tabs (Alozith is a strong general-purpose antibiotic), 20 Ionis water purifying tablets, two flexi bags, one metre adhesive tape, three metres long Spinlin cord, half a metre of reinforced ceramite-woven tape, three metres of cotton sewing thread, three sewing needles of various sizes, one surgical needle, eight safety fasteners of various sizes, a metre square piece of foil, one narrow-quill with Watersure ink, two sheets of rolled Sure-Write paper, a mirror-finished
plasteel case to hold the kit’s contents and serve as an impromptu signalling device.
