# Victory

- Hives
- Columns
- Large units
- Extermination

# Combat
For each number of units roll a d6, every 6 deals one wound
The wounded side allocates wounds
Hive counts as 1 unit

e.g. 1 Wasp Worker vs 2 Bee Workers

3d6 vs 4d6
[1,6,6] vs [2,3,5,6]

The wasp takes one wound, the bees take two wounds
The wasp downgrades their model (Large to Medium)
The Bee places one wound on each of their models (they could also put both on a single worker, killing it), and downgrades their model (Medium to small)
