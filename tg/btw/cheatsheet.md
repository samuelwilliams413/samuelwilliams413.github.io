## Fortune Points

Rogues start the adventure with 5 Fortune Points; other characters start with 3. You may spend a point to:

- Help a Friend: You can lend a helping hand to a friend, giving them a +2 bonus, even if you don’t havea relevant skill.
- Second Chance: You may spend a fortune point to reroll an ability check, saving throw, or to hit roll.
- Cheat Death: You may spend a fortune point if you reach 0 to -9 hit points. Doing so stabilizes you at 0 hit points for 24 hours (provided you don’t take additional damage).
- _Houserule > Plot Armor: You may spend a fortune point to force an enemy reroll an ability check, saving throw, or to hit roll._

Fortune points typically replenish at the end of an adventure.

## Magic Types

- **Cantrip**: To successfully cast a cantrip, the mage makes either an Intelligence or Wisdom test (the Cantrip specifies). If the roll fails, the player decides whether the mage has lost their magical energy until they have rested or if the cantrip has gone off with unpredictable effects. If the latter is chosen, the GM decides what happens. If the former is chosen, this impacts all forms of magic (including spells and rituals).
- **Spells**: A mage may cast a number of spells per day equal to their level. Note that cantrips and rituals may still be cast after this limit is reached.
- **Rituals**: Rituals require a great deal of time to perform. A ritual has a level associated with it, a mage must be of that level or more to perform it. The mage makes an Intelligence or Wisdom check (the ritual specifies). If the roll fails, the GM adds an unexpected effect to the ritual’s effect.

## True Name

- Spirits and magical creatures have true names, and these can be used as words of great power against those spirits and creatures (+5 bonus to all actions taken against those creatures and a +5 to saving throws against their powers and spells). Invoking a friend’s true name can give a +1 bonus.
- Some legends say that everyone possesses a True Name at birth, though few people ever come to know theirs.
