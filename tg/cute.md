## Core Mechanic
Everything a character might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll below it on a d6. A result of 1 is always a success.

Enemies donâ€™t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time an enemy would roll is for damage.

## Rolling Stats
Stats are generated with `1d6` in the following order Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA). If a stat of `6` is rolled the next must be rolled with `1d3 + 2`, then continue with `1d6` until the end or another `6` is rolled. Once all stats are generated 2 may be swapped around.

*Characters start at level 1*

## Leveling up

Roll 1d6 for each of your stats. If you roll higher than your stat, increase the value of the stat by 1.
