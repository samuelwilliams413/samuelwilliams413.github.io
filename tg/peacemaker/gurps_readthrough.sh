Pinkertons are mercenaries who work for Allan Pinkerton’s
detective agency. They bring many outlaws to justice, sometimes fighting against corrupt local officials or citizens who idolize certain outlaws. Many express companies and railroads hire
detectives to protect company property, solve cases, or guard
valuable shipments.
Detectives benefit from Alertness and Intuition. Reputations
are common. A detective’s agency may be a Patron.
Overconfidence and Stubbornness are typical disadvantages. Duties to employers and agencies are required. Enemies
from past cases are likely. Agency detectives typically have
Legal Enforcement Powers (10 points); they can make arrests
and engage in covert investigations. Some Pinkertons have a
Delusion that their Legal Enforcement Powers allow them to kill
with relative impunity.
Essential skills include Criminology, Guns, and Streetwise.
Acting, Area Knowledge, Disguise, Law, and Shadowing help.
