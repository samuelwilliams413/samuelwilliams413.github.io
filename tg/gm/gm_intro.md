Behind the scenes, quietly maintaining the miserable status quo of the World is a vast, nigh-insurmountable entity known as the God-Machine, a subtle, unknowable occult supercomputer with the power of God. This is not the God of the Bible, or the Qu'ran, or the Buddha, or innumerable pagan deities. No, the God-Machine's power flows from utter and undisputed mastery of physics, both mundane and not. Nobody knows its real agenda, not even its legions of angels, the sapient autonomous probes and programs that carry out its will.

Perhaps that is why so many of them turn on it.

Demons were once these angels: they were faced with an order they couldn't abide, lost faith in their missions, or faced with a situation that couldn't be solved within their purposes' parameters. Faced with either reprogramming or recycling for their disobedience, the Unchained chose to Fall, absorbing the facade of humanity the God-Machine gave them and becoming something more and less than they were. Now enemies of the Machine and all it stands for by default, demons now wage a secret war with the loyal angels, attempting to either destroy the God-Machine, reprogram it into something nicer, understand it, or simply live a semi-normal life.
