Behind the scenes, quietly maintaining the miserable status quo of the World is a vast, nigh-insurmountable entity known as the God-Machine, a subtle, unknowable occult supercomputer with the power of God. This is not the God of the Bible, or the Qu'ran, or the Buddha, or innumerable pagan deities. No, the God-Machine's power flows from utter and undisputed mastery of physics, both mundane and not. Nobody knows its real agenda, not even its legions of angels, the sapient autonomous probes and programs that carry out its will.

Perhaps that is why so many of them turn on it.

Demons were once these angels: they were faced with an order they couldn't abide, lost faith in their missions, or faced with a situation that couldn't be solved within their purposes' parameters. Faced with either reprogramming or recycling for their disobedience, the Unchained chose to Fall, absorbing the facade of humanity the God-Machine gave them and becoming something more and less than they were. Now enemies of the Machine and all it stands for by default, demons now wage a secret war with the loyal angels, attempting to either destroy the God-Machine, reprogram it into something nicer, understand it, or simply live a semi-normal life.


# So what is the God-Machine?
Nobody knows. No, seriously. The God-Machine is an enigma; even the Unchained only know that this is thing is real, that it created them as angels, and that they followed its commands without question before they Fell.

Partly physical, partly digital, partly spiritual, partly technological, partly scientific and partly magical, the God-Machine is a sprawling labyrinthine entity-device that spreads itself across space, time and reality itself. It seems as if it seeks to perpetuate the status quo of the world, but its mind (assuming it's even sentient) is so far removed from the human psyche that its motives are all but unknowable. Not even its angels can say what its goals really are, only that they were created to serve it.

In addition to its angels, the God-Machine will use humans (and occasionally other supernatural beings) to accomplish its goals. While It does not seem to understand much about the human mind and is thought to be unable to communicate directly with them, It has a solid understanding of how people react to rewards and punishments and has influenced the creation of many cults that unknowingly carry out its instructions.


## And Infrastructure is?
In a nutshell, Infrastructure refers to the "programs" or "projects" that the God-Machine is running. Like the God-Machine itself, these span the physical realm and many of the occult realms, weaving together in ways no human could hope to understand to produce bizarre outputs for reasons that are utterly incomprehensible. While many of these are supernatural at least in part, the Machine is nothing if not efficient and will create Infrastructure from purely mundane elements if it would be more effective. Its also worth noting that Infrastructure can be completely mundane in its cause and effect in addition to its composition. An example might be a police station (Defense Infrastructure) built right next to the town hall with all the people plugged into the matrix in the basement: The speed at which the police will intervene in the event of a security breach and the fact that killing them will create a whole bunch of evidence will work to keep all but the most bold Demons away. Or maybe the mail service (Logistics Infrastructure) is controlled by a GM cult at the highest level but otherwise is completely normal, staffed by completely normal people and is probably vital to a city's smooth functioning and any attacks on it or disruptions to it will bring federal attention.

Demons have classified Infrastructure into five basic categories:

**Concealment**: Infrastructure designed to hide the God-Machine's operations from prying eyes. Things like a fake restaurant to keep mortals from poking around in the basement, or a paint whose color causes people to ignore anything painted with it.

**Defense**: Infrastructure used to repel intruders that were able to bypass Concealment Infrastructure. Can be anything from security guards to guardian angels.

**Logistics**: Infrastructure dealing with location, acquisition, and transport of raw materials to be used in the God-Machine's outputs. This can be anything from ordinary vehicles to long-lost relics, to say nothing of what the "raw materials" might be.

**Elimination**: Infrastructure for disposing/recycling of any evidence following the success or failure of the God-Machine's projects. Depending on the circumstances, this could be as mundane as arson or as esoteric as a mage in the God-Machine's service erasing the memories of anyone in the area.

**Command and Control**: Infrastructure that coordinates the factors that will eventually lead to the output desired by the God-Machine. Their critical role means that they are rarely discovered (due to the extensive use of Concealment Infrastructure to hide their presence).
