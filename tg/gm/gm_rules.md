# The Core Mechanic
Everything a character might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll **BELOW** it on a d20.

Monsters don’t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time a monster would roll is for damage.

If a test is difficult a penantly may be applied to a character. E.g. with a penalty of 2 a a character would treat their relevant attribute stat as 2 lower than it actually is.

# Character Creation
## Rolling Stats
Stats are generated with 3d6 in the following order Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA). If a stat of 15+ is rolled the next must be rolled with 2d6 + 2, then continue with 3d6 until the end or another 15+ is rolled. Once all stats are generated 2 may be swapped around.

*Characters start at level 1 with 1 HD*

# Combat
When a character attacks a creature they must roll below their STR stat for a Melee Attack or DEX for a Ranged Attack. Likewise, when a creature attacks, the character must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack and DEX against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A GM will often give the stat required for the test.

The damage an attack deals is based on the character’s class or the number of HD a monster has.

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

## Initiative
To determine who acts in what order, at the start of combat each side rolls a d6. Whoever rolls highest gos first. Sides take turns.

- If one side is surpised they go second.
- If one side has a better chance to go first they may roll muliple d6 and choose the highest.
- Characters on each side act in any order within their turn.

## Player Turn
During a player’s turn a character may move and perform an action. They could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell - interacting with the world is an action. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

## Crits
If a player making an attack rolls a 1, they double the result of the damage dice they roll. If they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they take double damage.

## Dual Wielding
You may wield two weapons at the same time:

- Both weapons must be one handed.
- Every time you would normally be able to attack you may attack with each weapon.
- Both weapon's attack die is reduced by 1 (```d12>d10>d8>d6>d4>1```)

## Two handed weapons
You may wield a weapon with two hands:

- Weapon must be two handed.
- When you deal damage, deal bonus damage equal to your total number of attacks per round. E.g L3 Warrior = 1d8 + 3

## Sword and Board
You may wield a shield and 1 handed weapon at the same time:

- Shields provide AP as normal
- Shield provide damage reduction. When you take damage reduce tha mount take by your current damage reduction.
- You may not deal damage with a shield.

# Out Of Combat
## Healing
Characters can gain Hit Points from Spells, Potions, and Abilities. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero either.

## Resting
When characters rest for about an hour, they regain the use of all their Armor points. Also once per day, after resting, they may roll a Hit Die associated with their class and regain that many HP.

## Encumbrance
A character can carry a number of items equal to their STR with no issues. Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered and all attribute tests are taken with Disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. They simply cannot carry more than double their STR.

# Miscellaneous

## Experience

Treasure, loot, and wealth are how you gain experience. **For every gold piece of wealth you gain 1 xp.**

|Level|Experience Requirement|
|-----------:|:-----------|
|1|1,000|
|2|2,000|
|3|4,000|
|4|8,000|
|5|16,000|
|Higher|x2 Previous|

*Characters start at level 1*

This is the primary method for gaining XP in the game. However, not all monetary gains are counted as “treasure.” The following may gain the characters wealth, but they **do not count** for XP purposes.

- Coins looted from bodies outside of adventure locations
- Rewards
- Selling magical items that have been used by a PC or retainer
- Tax income
- Theft of wealth from mundane merchants, rulers, and citizens
- Trade, commerce, and other business activity (including selling of mundane items stripped from foes)


The following treasures **do count** for XP purposes:

- All valuable objects recovered from uncivilised or abandoned areas
- Money hoarded by creatures who have no actual use of it

Treasure is calculated for XP only after it has been returned to a secure location.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.
