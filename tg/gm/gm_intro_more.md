# So what is the God-Machine?
Nobody knows. No, seriously. The God-Machine is an enigma; even the Unchained only know that this is thing is real, that it created them as angels, and that they followed its commands without question before they Fell.

Partly physical, partly digital, partly spiritual, partly technological, partly scientific and partly magical, the God-Machine is a sprawling labyrinthine entity-device that spreads itself across space, time and reality itself. It seems as if it seeks to perpetuate the status quo of the world, but its mind (assuming it's even sentient) is so far removed from the human psyche that its motives are all but unknowable. Not even its angels can say what its goals really are, only that they were created to serve it.

In addition to its angels, the God-Machine will use humans (and occasionally other supernatural beings) to accomplish its goals. While It does not seem to understand much about the human mind and is thought to be unable to communicate directly with them, It has a solid understanding of how people react to rewards and punishments and has influenced the creation of many cults that unknowingly carry out its instructions.


## And Infrastructure is?
In a nutshell, Infrastructure refers to the "programs" or "projects" that the God-Machine is running. Like the God-Machine itself, these span the physical realm and many of the occult realms, weaving together in ways no human could hope to understand to produce bizarre outputs for reasons that are utterly incomprehensible. While many of these are supernatural at least in part, the Machine is nothing if not efficient and will create Infrastructure from purely mundane elements if it would be more effective. Its also worth noting that Infrastructure can be completely mundane in its cause and effect in addition to its composition. An example might be a police station (Defense Infrastructure) built right next to the town hall with all the people plugged into the matrix in the basement: The speed at which the police will intervene in the event of a security breach and the fact that killing them will create a whole bunch of evidence will work to keep all but the most bold Demons away. Or maybe the mail service (Logistics Infrastructure) is controlled by a GM cult at the highest level but otherwise is completely normal, staffed by completely normal people and is probably vital to a city's smooth functioning and any attacks on it or disruptions to it will bring federal attention.

Demons have classified Infrastructure into five basic categories:

**Concealment**: Infrastructure designed to hide the God-Machine's operations from prying eyes. Things like a fake restaurant to keep mortals from poking around in the basement, or a paint whose color causes people to ignore anything painted with it.

**Defense**: Infrastructure used to repel intruders that were able to bypass Concealment Infrastructure. Can be anything from security guards to guardian angels.

**Logistics**: Infrastructure dealing with location, acquisition, and transport of raw materials to be used in the God-Machine's outputs. This can be anything from ordinary vehicles to long-lost relics, to say nothing of what the "raw materials" might be.

**Elimination**: Infrastructure for disposing/recycling of any evidence following the success or failure of the God-Machine's projects. Depending on the circumstances, this could be as mundane as arson or as esoteric as a mage in the God-Machine's service erasing the memories of anyone in the area.

**Command and Control**: Infrastructure that coordinates the factors that will eventually lead to the output desired by the God-Machine. Their critical role means that they are rarely discovered (due to the extensive use of Concealment Infrastructure to hide their presence).
