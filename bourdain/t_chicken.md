# Method

1. Cook rice (WASH IT)
1. Heat garlic and ginger in oil until it smells good
2. Add Mirin, Sake, and Soy Sauce. Lightly simmer
3. Add 2 parts corn starch to 4 parts water, add to sauce
4. Fry protein, fry veggies
5. Mix it all together and serve on rice


> The sauce can be cooked at any time and reused later. Letting it sit will make it better

> Try salting the chicken and letting it sit (30min or overnight), skin side up, to make it easier to get a crispy skin

> I would really like to try this with a whole chicken that I've carved, and then cooking the veggies in the rendered fat
