His clerics use the white spell list. His favored weapon is the Staff. Devotees of Old Man Time are forbidden from seeking immortality and consider attempts at legacy to be futile.

Young women seeking to escape the trappings of abusive marriages often pledge themselves to Hysteria, nullifying their marriage. Devotees to Hysteria are living temples her and remain fit, active, and slim into old age. Holy color: Scarlet.

His titles include 'King of Loss', 'Final friend', 'Ossum of the Bone Throne'. His clerics use the black spell list. His favored weapon is the Battle Axe. Traditionally elves have an antagonist relationship with Father Ossum.

Leviathoth is nefarious god of darkness, the sea, despair, and the raging void. His clerics use the black spell list. He is hated and hates Anitoch and Ossum. It is said that demons are the children of Hysteria and Leviathoth. His favored weapon is the Bardiche. Devotees do not worship openly as it is often a 25 year prison sentence to be caught worshipping the dreadwyrm. Holy Color: Black.

> I'll put together the black and green spell lists if anyone asks. The white spell list is the standard cleric list with chaotic spell variants forbidden.

- **Horror Cults**: *Players may not be members of Horror cults. All player characters believe that horror cults are evil and should be annihilated.* Some vile humans worship the 'beings from outside'. These dark gods demand profane sacrifices and blaspheme existence itself. Worshipers often defile animals, children, virgins, and themselves in exchange for power, longevity, and revenge. Horror cults are universally evil, outlawed, and hunted. It is said worshippers of Leviathoth are sympathetic to cultists.
