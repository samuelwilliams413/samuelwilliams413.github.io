## Misc

- **Fighting men improvement**: At each level, including the first fighting men may increase a single ability score by 1.
- **Dual wielding**: Like a sword and shield, except instead of +1 to AC, the player gains +1 to hit.
- **Identifying**: Make a Esoterica check. For each day spent researching in a suitable location reroll the check with a cumulative +1.
- **Multiclassing**: Advance as per the steepest XP progression of all your intended classes. When you gain enough to level select a single of you classes to level.  If you decide to multiclass into a class with a steeper XP progression you must gain XP to the appropriate level before gaining additional levels. The most restrictive feature set is always chosen (e.g. a fighter 2/Cleric 1 may not use edged weapons).
- **I wanna play a ___**
    - **Druid**: Fighter/Cleric (green)
    - **Paladin**: Fighter/Cleric
    - **Ranger**: Fighter/Cleric (green)
    - **Blackguard**: Fighter/Cleric (black)
    - **Barbarian**: Fighter
    - **Monk**: Get that weeb shit out of here
    - **EK/Battlemage**: Fighter/MU (Wizard or Runespeaker)
    - **AT/assassin/spellblade/jedi**: Fighter/MU (Illusionist)
- **Staring equipment**: Every character always has with them (this does not contribute to encumbrance):
    - camping equipment
    - a utility knife
    - a tinderbox

**Languages**

The following languages exist:

- **Common**: common is the lingua franca, spoken by not only humans, but also dwarves, kitsune, valkyrie, and ghosts. All characters start speaking, reading, and writing common.
- **Arcane**: technically a dead language, arcane is used in magical treatise and academic documents. Arcane uses a modified helios script
- **Runic**: rarely spoken, runic is used dwarves and enchanters for the creation of monuments, records, and magical items. Its clean straight lines and absence of curves make it well suited to chiseling and engraving
- **Vulgate**: the language of goblins, ogres, and necromancers. The language is guttural and harsh. Many common words in vulgate sounds like obscenities in helios
- **Helios**: spoken by all outsides (angels, demons, and djinn) helios is incredibly precise in its grammar and syntax. Helios script is constructed of intricate circular sigils and seals.
- **Sylvan**: sylvan is the language of poets, elves, and nature spirits. The sylvan script doubles as a musical notation, giving indications how words can by sung or played on an instrument

### Level 1

#### Berries

The Druid creates 1d6 magical berries in his hand. Each berry restores 1 HP when eaten. All magical berries wither at sundown.

#### Bind Familiar (basic)

In order to cast this spell the magic-user must gather 100 gold pieces in material components and spend one hour preparing a ritual circle. After casting the spell, a small mundane creature (like a cat, rat, raven, or squirrel) is summoned and bound to the magic-user's service. It will follow basic commands (sit, stay, attack, etc.) and the magic-user can sense the familiar's basic emotional state (happy, afraid, nervous). The newly bound familiar is totally loyal to the magic-user and cannot be magically compelled to betray them.

Regardless of the animal chosen, all basic familiars have the following statistics: AC: 7 [12], HD: 1-1, HP: 5, Atk: +0, Dmg: 1d6-2, ST: +2, Mv: 12.

Familiars may have unique traits depending on their animal type. Cats may see well in darkness or be difficult to surprise and ravens have the ability to fly, for example. The referee is the final arbiter of what the familiar's capabilities are.  If the familiar is ever slain, the caster permanently loses a single hit point. A magic-user may release a familiar from their service at any time through an hour-long ritual, but may never be bound to more than one familiar any given time

#### Blinding flash

- Duration: Ten rounds

This spell targets a single subject who is exposed to a bright flash which bursts forth from the caster's hand. Unless the target makes a successful saving throw they are blinded for the duration of the spell.

#### Charm Animal

This spell operates in the same manner as the Charm Person spell of the Magic-User, but affects animals.

#### Circle of protection

- Duration: 1 hour per caster level

This spell requires one hour of preparation before being cast. The wizard must inscribe on the ground or floor, a circle of magical runes and reagents. The cost for these materials is 25 gold pieces. When this spell is cast, the prepared circle becomes empowered with magical protections, granting all those within it's 20'x20' area a -2 [+2] bonus to their armor class and +2 to all saving throw for the duration of the spell.

#### Obscuring fog

- Duration: 1 hour per level

The caster summons forth a cloud of thick, heavy fog rises from the ground and fills an area no larger than 20 cubic feet. This fog is very difficult to see through, and attacking with a missile weapon while in the fog or attacking a target hidden in the fog with a missile weapon causes a -3 penalty on all “to-hit” rolls. The cloud cannot be seeing through and may also conceal those within it at the referee's discretion.

#### Summon bound object

The caster immediately summons one bound object to their hand as long as it is on the same plane of existence.

#### Summon Servant

- Duration: Ten rounds per level

The caster summons an invisible, incorporeal servant which has a Strength of 10. It can carry objects and perform simple tasks, but does not fight and cannot be targeted in combat. It will only act in a manner commanded by the caster and cannot speak or function independently.

### Level 2

#### Acid Beam

- Duration: 1 round per level

When a magic-user casts this spell, they launch a ray of bubbling acid at their target. The magic-user makes a to-hit roll with a +3 bonus against their target. If the attack is successful the target suffers 1d6 points of damage, though the target may making a successful saving throw in order to take half damage (minimum one point). On successive round of the spell's duration, the target suffers another 1d6 points of damage, though they may make another saving throw in order to take half damage.

#### Animal Messenger

The Druid summons a tiny animal in his hand (for example: bird, rat), that will try to reach it's recipient. The Druid may attach a scroll with a message to the animal. When the messenger reaches its recipient – it disappears.

#### Defender's Ward

- Duration: Ten rounds per caster level

By making a rapid magical gesture of protection, the magic-user receives a -3 [+3] bonus to their armor class and a +1 bonus to all saving throws for the duration of this spell.

#### Disarm

The magic-user selects a single target within 120' feet. That target must make a saving throw or immediately drop an object (such as a weapon or shield) held in their hand. The item can be retrieved normally, though doing so prevents the target from attacking on the round of retrieval.

#### Fog

- Range: 250 ft.
- Duration: Until dispelled

This spell creates a thick magical fog in the area. Every creature, except the Druid, can barely see in this fog and receives a -4 To-Hit penalty while trying to fight in these conditions.

#### Halfling's Luck

- Duration: 1 round per caster level

For the duration of this spell the magic-user receives a +2 bonus on all “to-hit” rolls when making a missile attack and can be quite stealthy when not engaged in combat or performing other obvious actions (such as casting spells) rendering them almost hard to spot and almost totally silent (ADV on stealth).

#### Sharpen Senses

- Duration: 6 hours

The target of this spell can detect secret and concealed doors on WIS simply by passing within 10' of them. If actively searching, the chance of success is improved by +5. They may even attempt to search for traps with a +5 chance of success, though they are not able to disarm them.

#### Wall crawling

- Duration: 1d6 rounds per level

The caster of this spell can walk on walls and other vertical surfaces at their normal movement rate for the spell's duration. They may even walk on ceilings for the duration, though only at half movement. When this spell's duration ends, the caster is immediately at the mercy of gravity.

#### Warp Wood

- Range: 30 ft.

This spell causes wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means.
