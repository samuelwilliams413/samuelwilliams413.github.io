## Alternative initiative

Instead of rolling 1d20 + DEX for initiative instead we will be trying an alternative system. It works like this.

1. Consider what action you want to perform this turn (attack, cast a spell, move, etc).
2. Roll whatever damage die you where going to use roll that:
	- if you have some sort of magical effect that changes your normal damage, ignore it. (e.g. when a paladin smites they just roll their weapon die)
	- If you are casting a spell that deals no damage use a d12
	- If you are performing a non-standard action (e.g. using an object) roll a d8
3. Lowest goes first. Movement acts at initiative 0.
