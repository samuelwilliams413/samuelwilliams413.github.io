#### Special 
- **Undead Fortitude**. If damage reduces the wanderer to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the wanderer drops to 1 hit point instead.
- **Hordes**. Loud noises and bright lights made near a wanderer infested area attact 1d4 wanderers.
- **Blight**. Being bitten by a wanderer infects the victim. If a victim fails their saving throw, unless they sever the affected limb or recieve Lesser Restoration before the next dawn they will become blighted. Once blighted, there is no cure. While blighted their hitpoint maximum is reduced by 1 each day. If at any point while blighted the victim dies or becomes unconcious they immediately become a wanderer. 

#### Actions
**Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: (1d6) bludgeoning damage. Target must make a DC 10 CON save vs disease to avoid contracting the Blight
