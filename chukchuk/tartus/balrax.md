# Balrax the Spine of Torment

- [Back to tartus](index.md)

So you can see the setting summary [here](index.md), basically I have this immortal evil ghost wizard called Balrax the Spine of Torment. He does "stuff" mostly cloak and dagger, working through intermediaries. I'm not sure about what Balrax wants, what he believes in, or why he was trapped in the prison realm. Balrax also created and controls the Megablock Balrax. I'm unsure of what it looks like. However I do like the idea of a super structure that was grown like a massive spine piecing through the earth and into the clouds. In any case Balrax (the city) needs to be large enough that mapping streets or building in not feasible. Also its surrounded by wastes, zombies, and raiders.

The party is going to spend a good deal of time in Balrax and some plot hooks might come from the guy. What I'd like you to do (completely optional) is flesh out Balrax the person and balrax the city. Ideally, I'd have a good enough idea of balrax that I could anticipate what hes going to do left to his own devices and what he's going to do when the players interfere. Also knowing what kind of minions he uses would help. And for the city I'd like to be able to have a clear mental image of the hustle and bustle, how people get by, and what kinds of random crap you can buy or run into.

Also, Balrax might not be a wizard or a ghost or humanoid, you can change things. Don't ask for permission.
