	- Whatever blows your goat
	- Snipped it in the butt
	- Looks like the upper hand is on the other foot!
	- This may come back to haunt you in the ass
	- Let's not beat around the dead horse.
	- Fool me twice, that's company. Fool me three times, that's a charm.
	- Being right twice a day doesn't make you a clock
	- A bird in the stink is worth two in the pink
	- The cats out of the barn
- They have no idea how long humans live. They know it isn’t very long, but can’t quite remember if it’s like 5 years or 200 or what.

	> “Perhaps your son can help us?”
	> 
	> “He’s 7!”
