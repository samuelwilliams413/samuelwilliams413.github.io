# Big Plot

- There is a lich, somewhere. Everytime they die you narrow down the location of their phylactery. They're actually kinds shit at fighting, but hard to kill permanently.

# Smol Plots

- Bunch of lizardmen/goblins/kobolds have a cup/tablet/shard that they worship. Get the cup. (alternative: they worship where its stored and you can just ask for it nicely)
