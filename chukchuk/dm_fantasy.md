# Big Plot

- There is a lich, somewhere. Everytime they die you narrow down the location of their phylactery. They're actually kinds shit at fighting, but hard to kill permanently.

## ROBUST DESIGN

- THREE CLUE RULE
- GOAL-ORIENTED OPPONENTS
- DON’T PLAN SPECIFIC CONTINGENCIES
- KNOW YOUR TOOLKIT

## Other things

- > I love telegraphing moves on a boss. So, I make custom bosses that are put to the test in oneshots. Instead of using Lair Actions on Initiative Count 20, I have them prepare a powerful boss action that then triggers on the next Initiative Count 20.
- Roll initiative ahead of time (end of combat) 
- BE JOHN WOO, JACK KIRBY, AND STEVE DITKO


- > three test system. Look at what your players can do and have put points / levels into. This is what they want to do, so help them do it. Try and figure into an adventure
	- > A hard test of their main abilities that gives a bonus if they pass.
	- > An easy test so they feel badass. Reuse stuff from low level test 1. Like a fighter vs a gang of goblins. So they can see theyre more powerful.
	- > A test against something theyre bad at, with no real penalties if they fail. Reminds them theyre not good at everything, gets the party working together, boosts role play and party, plus an opportunity for comedy. Think barbarian at elf prince masked ball, ice skating or unskilled horse riding
- Monsters to consider
	- The Boggle (loneliness), the Redcap (rage), the meenlock (envy/paranoia) etc they are all easy to stick into any spot and make engaging. I once had a Boggle steal a teddy bear from the party to give to the orphan boy that created it in his loneliness, great stuff.
	- Ropers
	- Shadows
	- Bulette
	- Animated objects are completely "wait WHAT!" when the players see them start moving while in the middle of being busy with something. Nothing says "let's get out of here" like flying swords soaring towards your throats.

# Smol Plots

- Bunch of lizardmen/goblins/kobolds have a cup/tablet/shard that they worship. Get the cup. (alternative: they worship where its stored and you can just ask for it nicely)
- Deliver a love letter
- Penetration test a castle
- Make a trade with some gnomes
- Get a goat to the ritual
	- Chews through ropes/escapes
	- Won't let them sleep at all
	- Attracts large predator beasts
	- Gives them fleas
	- They get harassed by local animal rights activists
	- Farmer is missing a goat that looks identical to it
	- Eats their food
	- Eats their clothing
	- Gets loose in a crowded market
	- Falls down a well
	- Specifically dislikes the members of the party that don't want to let it be
	- killed
	- A local thug steps in its poop
	- Someone offers to buy it for more than it's worth


# Shin, the dragon

- Young man, with a Fu Manchu mustache
- [Old golden lung](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/fe/fc/7efefc7f5090fb01e0e66d159f073b29.jpg) trying out being a human. Jovial, excited and willing to give anything a go. Very Aloof.
	- Whatever blows your goat
	- Snipped it in the butt
	- Looks like the upper hand is on the other foot!
	- This may come back to haunt you in the ass
	- Let's not beat around the dead horse.
	- Fool me twice, that's company. Fool me three times, that's a charm.
	- Being right twice a day doesn't make you a clock
	- A bird in the stink is worth two in the pink
	- The cats out of the barn
- They have no idea how long humans live. They know it isn’t very long, but can’t quite remember if it’s like 5 years or 200 or what.

	> “Perhaps your son can help us?”
	> 
	> “He’s 7!”
	> 
	> “Right, of course. That’s far too.... young?”

	- LE (undead)

- [*Bramblegeist*](https://i.redd.it/0vrhv9y6osq31.jpg) nature spirits inhabit thorns and vines to create a terrifying 
	- Plant/Spirit
	- Tangles
	- Quiet
	- CN (Fey)

	- Weak (vulnerable to everything but hard to hit)

- [*Grootslang*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grootslang): *The Grootslang is to be a creature as old as the world. The gods made a mistake by giving too much strength, cunning and intelligence to the first creatures. They then divided said creatures, creating the first elephants and the first snakes in the process.*

- [*Vampire*](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/2a50fed6-5f37-42b3-aba5-b48c99a0aa08/d9466ek-52a4a752-ab41-48ee-bfb5-b4a15f425661.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzJhNTBmZWQ2LTVmMzctNDJiMy1hYmE1LWI0OGM5OWEwYWEwOFwvZDk0NjZlay01MmE0YTc1Mi1hYjQxLTQ4ZWUtYmZiNS1iNGExNWY0MjU2NjEuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.HTp-YcclgcVewA7r7xl5qr4Fsimtc5q-5nqeuzorB7g) - http://vampireunderworld.com/african-vampires/

- **But the greatest danger are the witches, as terrible and mighty as european dragons and devils. The countless legends tell of powers such as: causing storms, diseases and curses; create and control zombies and monsters; that a dead witch becomes an evil spirit; that witches can be identified by the small mouths full of sharp teeth in their backs; they may transform into or ride nocturnal creatures; are cannibals; use talking owls, hyenas and baboons as messengers; cause sleeping people to suffer nightmares full of demons that kill out of sheer terror. But the worst part may be that witches sell their services to whoever may pay for them.**

		- *People*: Mixture of wealthy dwarves and officers supervising and lounging in the noble quarters. Humans (slaves, servants, peasant) work the mines.
		- *Vibe*: Austere, oppressive, constrasted by opulence and wealth
		- **Sam notes**: Order is mantained through a highly coordinated and organised guardforce (ordinators). Additionally porticullius can be used to separate and isolate any portion of the mine/city eliminating the capacity for organised resistance. **Rallyhammer**

	- Being felled by Clark & Fisher, oppposed by Emerald Bazaar

	- Clark & Fisher Farms

		- Iron mining and copper mine
		- *Feel, smell*: Smoggy, dirty, dangerous. Smells like chemicals and smoke. Everything has soot on it.
		- *Architecture*: Aeris was constructed with no regard for the geography or beauty. Drainage is poor. The water is foul. Bugs and pests infest the town. The buildings vary between warehouses and shacks.
		- *People*: Sabulo once lived here but have been driven from the land. Gold vipers now wander the street. Crime flourishes. The people stay and keep coming because profits are high.
		- *Vibe*: Dangerous, dirty, and cruel. The people are desperate and violent. Trust is non-existent
		- **Sam notes**: All your worst sterotypes of an african city.
- Ossum Mountain
	- Black Gold Mine - operating
- Cronos Desert
	- Two pyramids, one floating upside down, tip to tip. Stone slowly falls from the top to the bottom like a colossal hourglass

	- **Elysmouth** *gateway to Sabulo*
		- Port city and political power center
		- Savanna, and start of river
		- *Bloodnexus* a grand ziggurat, covered in millions of small carvings, upon which two large stone bowls sit. The leaders gather and cast votes by letting their own blood. The blood is consumed by the ziggurat and the ammendment is wriiten in stone. A quorum of 37 is required for a valid vote (to mitigate a single member contributing too much).
- Thoth Bay
	- Elysium Island
		- Elysium Ruins
		- Hammersong Elysium Salt Mine - under construction

		- *Feel, smell*:
		- *Architecture*: 
		- *People*:
