# Tartus
![image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/e6/54/e4e6549114f8b8120b24dcade1a7a7d7.jpg)

Tartus is a Dyson sphere that sits in the demiplane of a mad wizard. It's ruled by ghost wizards, vampires, and monsters. It's always twilight, damp, muddy, and grim. Anything that dies on the plane becomes an undead. Due to a severe deficit in bedrock the intelligent life on the plane clusters in megacities that reach into the sky.

The players need to stop the big baddie by retrieving a McGuffin locked in a dungeon vault. The vault was created by a band of adventurers 50 years ago (now old, scattered, retired or dead). Either figure out how to get through each stage of the dungeon yourself, or seek out the old heroes for help.

- **Style**: Popcorn Adventure + Megadungeon / Diablo / Barrowmaze + High Fantasy
- **System**: DND 5e, Pathfinder, Shadow of the Demon Lord, an OSR clone of my own making
- **Politics**: Medium (getting factions to align with you is just another way of clearing the dungeon)
- **Role Playing**: High (lots of stuff to talk your way out of)
- **Self direction**: Low (You’ll know who to talk to, where, and why)
- **Tactics**: High (I’ll be throwing lots of problems that require more than brute force)
- **Heroism**: High (low gravity physics, low lethality, and world ending stakes)
- **Levity**: Medium (fun, but not murder hobos with no conscience)
- **Influences**: Standard DND, The Mummy, Indiana Jones, Zombie movies
- **The campaign will only work if**: You’re playing heroes who want to save the world. You want to do big epic audacious stuff. You’re not playing murder hobos.

# The Zone

The game takes place within the Zone, an alternate history version of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. After the initial Chernobyl disaster, attempts were made to repopulate the area, primarily with scientists and military personnel. However, in 2006, almost 20 years after the first incident, a mysterious second disaster occurred, killing or mutating most of the inhabitants.

The game begins years later, after people have begun coming to the Zone in search of money, valuable artifacts, and scientific information. In keeping with the post-nuclear decay within the Zone, extreme radiation has caused mutations among animals and plants in the area. As a result of the second disaster, the Zone is also littered with dangerous small areas of altered physics, known as anomalies which contain extremely valuable and useful artifacts.

- **Style**: Survival Horror + Sandbox / Hex crawl / West Marches + Modern
- **System**: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. conversion that uses the in game equipment + STR, DEX, etc
- **Politics**: Low (Factions will exist, but there will be minimal intrigue)
- **Role Playing**: Medium (There will be friends to make)
- **Self direction**: High (completely player directed)
- **Tactics**: High (lots of things that can’t be negotiated with)
- **Heroism**: Low (lethality == high)
- **Levity**: Lower (Sad Russians)
- **Influences**: Stalker, sad Russians, the road, soviets, Andrei Tarkovsky
- **The campaign will only work if**: Your characters are more interested in exploration than developing a settlement. You're happy to scrap by living on the edge as the sun goes down and your bullets run out.

# The Cafe at the Edge of Time

They say that at the edge of the ring world there's a cafe where Old Man Time settled down to die. You and your band of heroes have decided to go there. Maybe you’re looking for a place to die. Or maybe adventure. Or glory and loot. Maybe you’ve got no where better to be. In either case the ring world is falling into the sun and you’re heading west.

Along the way you’ll see, touch, taste, and smell all the world has to offer. You’ll make friends, maybe bring some along, and maybe do some good on your pilgrimage. You’ll see things you’ll never see again, and the first time for everything will be the last.

- **Style**: Journey to the west / Grand Tour + Point crawl + Science Fantasy
- **System**: Any, an OSR clone of my own making
- **Politics**: Low (you won’t be in the same place long enough)
- **Role Playing**: High (You’ll do a lot of meeting people)
- **Self direction**: High (aside from “go west” you’re on your own)
- **Tactics**: Low (You can avoid a lot of stuff if you choose to)
- **Heroism**: Medium (You’ll have the opportunity to do lots of cool and kind stuff, but none of it will be super high stakes)
- **Levity**: High (The world will be weird)
- **Influences**: Ultraviolet Grasslands and the Black City, Top Gear, Dune
- **The campaign will only work if**: Your characters are committed to continuing their journey and won’t settle down at the first comfy town. You're willing to treat the world as if it were a living thing, and its inhabitants like people (not a meat bag of hit points and loot).
