## Character generation

1. [Roll stats](#rolling-stats)
1. [Pick a class](#classes)
1. [Pick an augmentation](#augmentations)

## Core Mechanic
Everything a character might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats - a player must roll a d6 and add their score, if the value is greater than the difficult (normally 7) they succeed.

## Rolling Stats
Stats are generated with `1d6` in the following order Fitness (FIT), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Knowledge (KNO), Wits (WIT), Charisma (CHA). If a stat of `6` is rolled the next must be rolled with `1d3 + 2`, then continue with `1d6` until the end or another `6` is rolled. Once all stats are generated 2 may be swapped around.

*Characters start at level 1*

## Leveling up

Roll 1d6 for each of your stats. If you roll higher than your stat, increase the value of the stat by 1.
