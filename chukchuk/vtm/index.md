A blood-hunt is called on a ??? childe. In the end, the characters find and kill him. He has a book which the everyone wants to find and use for various purposes. He may try to trade the book for his freedom and the characters' silence. The characters may kill him and just take the book. Either way, he's violated the masquerade while running from other cainites and the characters will have to sort the mess out at the same time as escaping from the different factions who want the book.

## Plot

- Book was taken from the Kurilpa Library, and the library burned down.
- Primogen Foster had a strong personal connection to the library and calls for a blood hunt.
- Primogen Roe thinks that Foster is hiding something and orders the Tremere to find the book first
- Primogen Milton wants to thwart Roe and please Drake and orders the Ventrue to find it
- Baron Gurney sends a gang to have a look at the site for evidence (firsts have been occuring in the Gap, its actually Sabbat)
- Ventrue and Gangrel get into a scuffle, Sabbat arrive and everything turns to shit
- Primogen Skippy provides film of the last few days showing a large book was taken.
- The party is ordered to find the neonate, and return the book to their Primogen or Drake.

> Its not actually about the book, it about who wants and what they are willing to destroy to have it.

**Clues:**

- Number plate
- Gang tattoo
- Blood at scene
- Rare shoes


_Its a brujah who overhead a coversation between Crane and Foster about old books. Its actually a book of poetry in Shilha. The fire was accidental?_

- The book has already been taken by Morrison. Morrison thinks its an arcane tome of power.
- Drake (Toreador, Malkavian, Nosferatu) , Roe (Tremere), Milton (Ventrue), and Gurney (Gangrel) each want to storm the place and take it back.
