A blood-hunt is called on a ??? childe. In the end, the characters find and kill him. He has a book which the everyone wants to find and use for various purposes. He may try to trade the book for his freedom and the characters' silence. The characters may kill him and just take the book. Either way, he's violated the masquerade while running from other cainites and the characters will have to sort the mess out at the same time as escaping from the different factions who want the book.

Each Clan and Bloodline has a unique set of powers called Disciplines, and their own set of weaknesses, also unique to that particular branch of vampire.

- Brujah: In ancient times, the Brujah were a clan of noble philosophers and warrior-poets. Since the loss of their city of Carthage, which was their crowning achievement, they have become a clan of malcontents, rebels, rogues, and anti-authoritarians. Brujah possess great passion, but this same passion makes it more difficult for them to resist the Beast. Brujah are one of the seven founding clans of the Camarilla.[8]

- Gangrel: A clan of animalistic shape-shifters who shun the cities for the wilderness beyond. Independent and more interested in their own survival, the Gangrel prefer to run with wild animals rather than play politics with others of their kind. Gangrel are masters of the Discipline Protean which allows them to change their bodies into bestial shapes. When Gangrel frenzy, they resemble the Beast, taking on animal features and disfigurements. Gangrel are one of the seven founding clans of the Camarilla, although their leadership broke from it close to the end of the 1990s in universe.[8]:20, 54-55 Now more associated with the Anarch Sect or act as Independents with a few staying loyal to the Camarilla.[11]:140, 406

- Malkavian: Malkavian are a clan of lunatics whose madness grants them strange insights. All members of this clan are insane in some way. They are one of the seven founding clans of the Camarilla.[8]:20, 60-61

- Nosferatu: The clan Nosferatu are doomed to wear their bestial nature on the outside. The Embrace turns its victims into hideous and deformed monsters who are marginalized by their appearance and forced to dwell in the shadows of the sewers. However, their lives on the fringes and their stealthy abilities allow them to learn secrets others would rather keep hidden; as a result, they often traffic in information. All Nosferatu are ugly and obviously monsters to the point that appearing openly would break the Masquerade. They are one of the founding members of the Camarilla.[8]:20, 62-63

- Toreador: Toreador are sensitive, artistic, and sometimes debauched hedonists fascinated by the mortal world and its artistic creations. Enthralled by the ever-changing mortal world, they are one of the few clans who seek to keep up with it. Toreador often Embrace for beauty or to preserve artistic talent. Beauty can utterly captivate them, immobilizing them for a period of time. They are one of the founding seven clans of the Camarilla.[8]:20, 68-69

- Tremere: Tremere are a clan of blood sorcerers and mages originally belonging to the Order of Hermes. Their Discipline of Thaumaturgy allows them to use the power of their blood to cast spells, but their dependency on Vitae makes them more easily susceptible to Blood Bonds. The clan is highly organized, and its members are all partially Blood Bound to the ruling seven Elders of the clan. They are one of the founding seven clans of the Camarilla.[8]

- Ventrue: The Ventrue are the aristocrats and kings of vampires, having historically played a leadership role among the clans. Ventrue seeks power and wealth to support its legacy of rulership over Kindred and Kine. Ventrue, as a clan, may only feed from a specific kind of vessel (e.g. virgins, blondes, youngest siblings) which the player selects using character creation.[8]:20, 72-73
