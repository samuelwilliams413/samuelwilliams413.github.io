# Character Creation

The process for character creation is as follows:

1. Generate your stats
2. Determine your magical talents
4. Purchase equipment
3. State your beliefs

## Generate your stats

There are 6 stats:

- Strength
- Agility
- Hardiness
- Wits
- Knowledge
- Will

Either:

1. Roll 6d6 in order, swaping a single pair of results
2. Assign [1,2,3,3,4,5] to your stats

## Determine your magical talents

[DETAILS FOR MAGIC CAN BE FOUND HERE](#magic)

Gnosis represents a characters capacity to do a certain kind of magic. To cast a spell you must expend at least one gnosis from the school of magic to which the spell belongs. If you use two gnosis from different schools it may count as one gnosis from the correct school. At character creation you start with 5 points of gnosis which may be allocated among any of the schools of magic. You can invest more that one point in any school.

The schools of magic are:

- Tranfiguration: Shapeshifting and lifecrafting
- Conjuration: Summoning and the creation of materials
- Judgement: The magic of oaths and retribution
- Illusion: Phantasms, mind magic, and truthfinding
- Mysticism: Soul magic, divination, and necromancy
- Sacred: Holy spells used for healing and strength

When you cast a spell you chose to invest a certain amount of gnosis in the casting, some spell have increased potency when the amount of gnosis used increases.

### Addiitonal Notes

- Anyone can cast any spell
- Spells are contained in great tomes, heavy tablets, arcane crystals, malformed staves, and etched skulls
- Casting a spell requires:
  - two hands, and lots of hand waving
  - line of sight to the target
  - clear ennunciation of an incantation, the incantation must be spoken loud enought that it *could* be hear by the target (they don't need to hear it to be effect, the sound just needs to reach them)
- Take a break to get your gnosis dice back (15min, time for a snack)

## Purchase equipment

Every character always has with them (this does not contribute to encumbrance):

- camping equipment
- a utility knife
- a tinderbox
- two sets of clothes

In addition they start with:

- a single spellbook
- two weapon sets
- 100 silver pieces (sp)

They may carry in total 4 items plus their strength.


[THE EQUIPMENT LIST CAN BE FOUND HERE](#equipment)

> Note: every 100 coints excluding the first 100 coins counts as 1 item

## State your beliefs

From each opf the pairs of beliefs select one that represnts the views of you character.

- **Constructivists** consider that people build themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the caracteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.
- **Essentialists** consider that an individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her caracteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate. <br> <br>
- **Rehabilitative justice**:the role of justice is to put the condemned on the “right path” again by making them understand why they should not do what they did and why they were condemned
- **Punitive justice**: the role of justice is dissuasive, both for the condemned (to avoid recidivism) and for the rest of the society (by making them examples not to follow). <br> <br>
- **Ecologie**: privileges the protection of the environment by limiting the impact of human activities.
- **Productivism**: privileges human needs notably by supporting the increase of the production or the use of methods that have an incertain impact on the environment. <br> <br>
- **Revolutionaries** have a tendency to privilege direct action to reach their goal: replace the current political organisation for totally different one.
- **Reformists** have a tendency to privilege legal action to reach their goal: reform the political organisation step by step. <br> <br>

# Magic
> There are 6 schools of magic, each associated with a vitrue and attribute. When magic from a school is performed it goves off an aura of a certain colour. The schools of magic were discovered/gifted/invented by its progenitors (supernatural beings with an affinity for magic)

|Brown      |Conjuration      |Hardiness     |Prudence    |Dwarves/Kobolds/Spirits of the Earth|
|Red        |Judgement        |Strength      |Justice     |Angels/Demons/Spirits of Fire|
|Green      |Illusion         |Wits          |Hope        |Elves/Fairies/Trickster Spirits|

## Judgement

> Judgement spells were given to great heros by angels and demons to destroy their foes. All spells of judgement inflict harm, and the school has deep ties to runic power. Judgement spells are often named after the entity that first gave them to man, and frequently require dice to be locked.

> Spells of judgment frequently use an Athame, or ceremonial blade, made from obsidian as a spellcasting focus. Spellcasting involves a highly intricate kata with the blade. If the blade is ever used as a weapon it is desecreated and must be ritually cleaned. If you are casting and disrupted you take 1 point of damage from the laccrations caused to you by the athame.

1. Hasmalel, the Named Bullet

1. [ Corrosive Touch ]	R: touch If you touch flesh, the target takes [sum] acid damage. If you touch an object subject to corrosion, it is damaged instead.

## Illusion

> Illusion spells were originally gifts given to children by trickster gods. After careful bargaining, and much suffering they were codified. Illusion spells do not change reality, instead they warp the minds of those effected. Paradoxically the names of illusion spells are literal and the school contains the only magic conerned with absolute truth. **All illusion spells are silent**

Spirits often have requests of sorcerers, given how they are during most of their existence hemmed in by rock and sky.

  - Range: shouting
  - Summon a cloud of opaque fog with radius [dice]x5m.
