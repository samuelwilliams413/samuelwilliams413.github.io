    - If you have more than 4 in the skill you can read **and** write in the language

**Languages**

The following languages exist:

- **Common**: common is the lingua franca, spoken by not only humans, but also dwarves, kitsune, valkyrie, and ghosts. All characters start speaking, reading, and writing common.
- **Arcane**: technically a dead language, arcane is used in magical treatise and academic documents. Arcane uses a modified helios script
- **Runic**: rarely spoken, runic is used dwarves and enchanters for the creation of monuments, records, and magical items. Its clean straight lines and absence of curves make it well suited to chiseling and engraving
- **Vulgate**: the language of goblins, ogres, and necromancers. The language is guttural and harsh. Many common words in vulgate sounds like obscenities in helios
- **Helios**: spoken by all outsides (angels, demons, and djinn) helios is incredibly precise in its grammar and syntax. Helios script is constructed of intricate circular sigils and seals.
- **Sylvan**: sylvan is the language of poets, elves, and nature spirits. The sylvan script doubles as a musical notation, giving indications how words can by sung or played on an instrument

## Determine your magical talents

[DETAILS FOR MAGIC CAN BE FOUND HERE](#magic)

Gnosis represents a characters capacity to do a certain kind of magic. To cast a spell you must expend at least one gnosis from the school of magic to which the spell belongs. If you use two gnosis from different schools it may count as one gnosis from the correct school. At character creation you start with 3 points of gnosis which may be allocated among any of the schools of magic. You can invest more than one point in any school.

The schools of magic are:

- Transfiguration: Shapeshifting and lifecrafting
- Conjuration: Summoning and the creation of materials
- Judgment: The magic of oaths and retribution
- Illusion: Phantasms, mind magic, and truthfinding
- Mysticism: Soul magic, divination, and necromancy
- Sacred: Holy spells used for healing and protection

When you cast a spell you chose to invest a certain amount of gnosis in the casting, some spell have increased potency when the amount of gnosis used increases.

### Additional Notes

- Anyone can cast any spell
- Spells are contained in great tomes, heavy tablets, arcane crystals, malformed staves, and etched skulls
- Casting a spell requires:
    - two hands, and lots of hand waving
    - line of sight to the target
    - clear annunciation of an incantation, the incantation must be spoken loud enough that it *could* be hear by the target (they don't need to hear it to be effect, the sound just needs to reach them)
- Take a break to get your gnosis dice back (15min, time for a snack)

## Purchase equipment
[THE EQUIPMENT LIST CAN BE FOUND HERE](#equipment)

Every character always has with them (this does not contribute to encumbrance):

- camping equipment
- a utility knife
- a tinderbox
- two sets of clothes

In addition they start with:

- a single spell codex
- two weapon sets
- 100 silver pieces (sp)

You may carry in total 4 items plus your strength.

From your avaliable spell codices, items, and weapon sets pick two to be 'readied'. Your readied weapons can be drawn/shealthed without requiring an action.

> Note: every 100 coins excluding the first 100 coins counts as 1 item
>
> 100 copper pieces == 1 silver piece, 100 silver pieces == 1 gold piece

## State your beliefs

From each of the pairs of beliefs select one that represents the views of you character.

- **Constructivists** consider that people build themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the characteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.
- **Essentialists** consider that an individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her characteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate. <br> <br>
- **Rehabilitative justice**:the role of justice is to put the condemned on the "right path" again by making them understand why they should not do what they did and why they were condemned
- **Punitive justice**: the role of justice is dissuasive, both for the condemned (to avoid recidivism) and for the rest of the society (by making them examples not to follow). <br> <br>
- **Ecologie**: privileges the protection of the environment by limiting the impact of human activities.
- **Productivism**: privileges human needs notably by supporting the increase of the production or the use of methods that have an uncertain impact on the environment. <br> <br>
- **Revolutionaries** have a tendency to privilege direct action to reach their goal: replace the current political organization for totally different one.
- **Reformists** have a tendency to privilege legal action to reach their goal: reform the political organization step by step. <br> <br>
