**Languages**

The following Languages exist:

- common
- arcane

## Determine your magical talents

[DETAILS FOR MAGIC CAN BE FOUND HERE](#magic)

Gnosis represents a characters capacity to do a certain kind of magic. To cast a spell you must expend at least one gnosis from the school of magic to which the spell belongs. If you use two gnosis from different schools it may count as one gnosis from the correct school. At character creation you start with 3 points of gnosis which may be allocated among any of the schools of magic. You can invest more that one point in any school.

The schools of magic are:

- Transfiguration: Shapeshifting and lifecrafting
- Conjuration: Summoning and the creation of materials
- Judgment: The magic of oaths and retribution
- Illusion: Phantasms, mind magic, and truthfinding
- Mysticism: Soul magic, divination, and necromancy
- Sacred: Holy spells used for healing and strength

When you cast a spell you chose to invest a certain amount of gnosis in the casting, some spell have increased potency when the amount of gnosis used increases.

### Additional Notes

- Anyone can cast any spell
- Spells are contained in great tomes, heavy tablets, arcane crystals, malformed staves, and etched skulls
- Casting a spell requires:
  - two hands, and lots of hand waving
  - line of sight to the target
  - clear annunciation of an incantation, the incantation must be spoken loud enough that it *could* be hear by the target (they don't need to hear it to be effect, the sound just needs to reach them)
- Take a break to get your gnosis dice back (15min, time for a snack)

## Purchase equipment
[THE EQUIPMENT LIST CAN BE FOUND HERE](#equipment)

Every character always has with them (this does not contribute to encumbrance):

- camping equipment
- a utility knife
- a tinderbox
- two sets of clothes

In addition they start with:

- a single spellbook
- two weapon sets
- 100 silver pieces (sp)

They may carry in total 3 items plus their strength.

From your avaliable spellbooks, items, and weapon sets pick two to be 'readied'. Your readied weapons can be drawn/shealthed without requiring an action.

> Note: every 100 coins excluding the first 100 coins counts as 1 item
> 
> 100 copper pieces == 1 silver piece, 100 silver pieces == 1 gold piece

## State your beliefs

From each of the pairs of beliefs select one that represents the views of you character.

- **Constructivists** consider that people build themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the characteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.
- **Essentialists** consider that an individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her characteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate. <br> <br>
- **Rehabilitative justice**:the role of justice is to put the condemned on the "right path" again by making them understand why they should not do what they did and why they were condemned
- **Punitive justice**: the role of justice is dissuasive, both for the condemned (to avoid recidivism) and for the rest of the society (by making them examples not to follow). <br> <br>
- **Ecologie**: privileges the protection of the environment by limiting the impact of human activities.
- **Productivism**: privileges human needs notably by supporting the increase of the production or the use of methods that have an uncertain impact on the environment. <br> <br>
- **Revolutionaries** have a tendency to privilege direct action to reach their goal: replace the current political organization for totally different one.
- **Reformists** have a tendency to privilege legal action to reach their goal: reform the political organization step by step. <br> <br>

# Combat

Each round of combat you may:

- Move up to 10m
- Perform one significant action
- Draw an avaliable item (specify up to two weapons or spell books that can be drawn quickly)
- Perform a reaction

Examples of significant actions include:

- Attacking
- Casting a spell
- Drinking a potion
- Sprinting

Examples of reaction actions include:

- Taking a small step

# Magic

## Judgment

> Judgment spells were given to great heroes by angels and demons to destroy their foes. All spells of judgment inflict harm, and the school has deep ties to runic power. Judgment spells are often named after the entity that first gave them to man, and frequently require dice to be locked.

> Spells of judgment frequently use an Athame, or ceremonial blade, made from obsidian as a spellcasting focus. Spellcasting involves a highly intricate kata with the blade. If the blade is ever used as a weapon it is desecrated and must be ritually cleaned. If you are casting and disrupted you take 1 point of damage from the lacerations caused to you by the athame.

## Illusion

> Illusion spells were originally gifts given to children by trickster gods. After careful bargaining, and much suffering they were codified. Illusion spells do not change reality, instead they warp the minds of those effected.

Spirits often have requests of sorcerers, given how they are during most of their existence hemmed in by rock and sky.

  - Summon a cloud of opaque fog with radius [dice]x5m.
