- [ Decollate ]	D: [dice] days		R: touch The target can safely remove their own head. They can still see through their own eyes, & can move their body around as usual. If you spend at least 4 dice on this spell, you can lock them to make the spell permanent.
- [ Dragon’s Breath ]	D: [dice] rounds	R: self You can breathe fire for the duration. Each breath of fire deals [sum] fire damage in a 15’ cone. The horribly hot breath deals [dice] fire damage to you each time it is used, if you’re not fire-resistant or something.

- [ Barrier of Force ]	D: [dice] rounds 	R: touch A barrier of force surrounds the target. Nothing (except for air) can pass inward through the barrier, though anything can pass outward. The barrier can be attacked; it breaks when [sum] points of damage are dealt to it.
- [ Black Tentancles ]	D: [dice] rounds	R: 60’ Black tentacles surge from the ground. Affects one 5’ square per [dice]. Victims must save vs. STR to escape, with a penalty equal to [dice], and the tentacles deal 1d6 damage to each victim per round.

## Destruction


- [ Agony ]	D: [dice] rounds	R: sight Target experiences wracking pain. They must save each round while afflicted or miss their turn.
- [ Bane Weapon ]	D: [dice] rounds	R: touch Touch the weapon and name a creature. The weapon [sum] extra damage to that creature for the duration. You can lock the dice used to make the effect permanent.
- [ Corpse Lantern ]	D: [dice] hours	R: touch Touch a corpse of human-size or smaller. It immediately begins to glow with a sickly light, & to float. It will drift after you for the spell’s duration, illuminating an area 10’ x [dice] in diameter.

- [ Magic Missile ]	R: 100’+50’x[dice] Fire one missile per [dice] that deals 1d6 points of magical force damage to whatever it hits. You can direct each missile to a different target. The missiles never miss.
- [ Named Bullet ]	R: touch Name your enemy while touching a piece of ammunition (arrow, sling bullet, etc). When the target is struck by this piece of ammunition, roll damage [dice] additional times. You must lock the dice used.
- Covenant Magically seal a bargain between the sorcerer and a counterparty by awarding temporary control of both souls to a devil. Free assent is required, but may be compelled by factors external to the magic (such as a dagger to the throat). Demonic malady rewards temporary deviation, and ignoring the covenant completely allows the devil to take permanent possession, which causes death (and eternal torment).

Seduce Waters
Divested of all equipment and clothing, the sorcerer bathes in a water, such as a river, lake, or pool (but not sea or ocean, as those old gods are wicked beyond measure) and in so doing communes with the spirit of the water. The water spirit will obey basic commands (though sometimes in fickle ways), and thus may be parted, lowered, or otherwise modified. Spirits often have requests of sorcerers, given how they are during most of their existence hemmed in by rock and sky.
