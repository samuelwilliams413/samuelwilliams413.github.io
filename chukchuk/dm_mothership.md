# Choice

<br>

> I take "bathroom breaks" at specific moments to let the players digest something that happened or to let them prepare before a big fight. I usually come out to them conspiratorially conversating and I think it's helped them bond and also helped them plan, analyze, and assess stuff that has happened and will happen.
> 
> I just fiddle on my phone for the five minutes in there.

<br>

> For example I'll pick a lvl 1 wizard. In order for that wizard to get to level 2, I'll let the player know they need to do 3 out of 5 goals to advance to the next level. Those goals for a level 1 could be:

- Scribe a scroll
- Find/make/buy a staff/wand etc.
- Pass an Arcane Check
- Impress a child with magic
- Use your background ability (see below)

> Now, the benefit of these 'objectives' is that you can tailor them to fit a campaign, Maybe your Barbarian isn't looking to kill so much anymore, but trying to get a tattoo that means Honor, or courage. Maybe that fighter needs to Swear a Vow to someone.

<br>

> Avoid naming the monster, describe its appearance instead.
