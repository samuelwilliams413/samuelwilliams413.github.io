## Wtf the fuck am I doing with my time

I was thinking about this while watching videos of some Canadian build a log cabin.

- He has a really really well-behaved and happy dog who likes to bite snow
- He made his own maple syrup
- strips and harvests all his own timber
- make some really tasty looking burgers

Anyways, I was looking in the side bar and all the youtube suggestions were for people doing the same thing. Learning survival skills or self-reliance or building a cabin or whatever. It seems like every tom, dick, and harry who's involved in survival stuff is making videos about it. It got me thinking.

The answer came pretty quick (in part because the ending of every video is the guy doing a reflection). When you have something good and of value you tend to want to share it. Anything with doing is worth sharing and passing on. I think everything i'm doing, as well as not accumulating to anything, is also pretty self-centered.

DND feels like:

1. A dead-end, nothing much really comes from each session. It honestly is starting to have the same problem as video games (moving pixels and button pressing > dice rolls and theatre of mind).
2. It doesn't create anything of lasting value
3. Its only really meaningful to me (or more that it has no meaning to players)

## A futile Search?

I'm beginning to wonder if I could find the same sense of accomplishment doing the same thing as *those people* I see. Cause as swell as a cabin is, the guy is doing it because it makes him happy. He enjoys doing the slow hard work. I don't know if that is for me.

I have a suspicion that I might get bored with those the same way I have with DnD. On the other hand I have found that the current system has been my longest running stint, in part because the frustrating elements have been removed. I'm in part bored because of the constraints that I placed upon myself. This however has been 9 weeks, almost 2 and half months of playing at least once a week. And its all gone pretty well. Perhaps if the last few sessions had been strong I wouldn't feel this way.

## Options

Well, thinking about this on the most whimsical level I have three options.

1. Reform the existing campaign (REFORM)
2. Change the campaign to something better (REVOLUTION)
3. Do something else (not dnd) (RAZE)

### Reform

ehh.... Perhaps I should isolate what about the thing feels so iffy.

#### Good (what i want more of)

- suspense
- danger
- clever
- unpredictability
- biting into lore
- good use of mechanics

basically players thinking hard, being silly, and surprising me

#### Bad (what i think is boring me)

- so much chaff
- players dicking about
- people just being lazy and jumping at things
- monty hall garbage
- nothing being of consiquence while everything mattering
- I feel like I'm out of ideas, and its more and more of a struggle to make things fun

its becoming increasingly stupid, ungrateful, pointless garbage.

#### Reform 2

- If the risks were real
- Prep was *less*, prep resulted in more stuff (3 hrs != 3 hrs worth, sometimes inspiration strikes)
- players were more engaged, awake, not retards (reckless)

hmmmm, idk if i need to lean heavier in player investment (roleplaying) or into danger and thrill (crunch & tactical)
I became frustrated with games that were very crunch heavy to the point of being cumbersome and restricive.

Is that a consiquence of every wargame?

idk, what times am i trying to recreate

##### Player:

- Running from the big dragon
- Dropping the log on the ogre
- Almost stealing the bag
- teleporting away from the dread titan (MTG)

Making a plan, reacting to things, thinking on my feet and ahead

##### DM:

- Eaty Eaty Jelly Feety
- Room swap
- Teleport into firestorm to cut in half
- Angry furby tulpa
- Jew shadows
- Doppleganger and the Ziggurat

Players make a plan, get engaged, think on their feet, surpise me, get away with it.

#### Reform 3

I guess the thing of note here is that none of these things were based on a really clever problem. They were caused by the fog of war, consiquences, and planning on the move. Actually many of the highlights can be described as

1. Party has goal
2. Party makes plan
3. Party executes
4. Something goes awry
5. Party adapts & dies

My role in this would be to define:

- A goal (or help curate one)
- Create a sandpit for a plan
- Create a complication
- Play fair (crosshairs on everyone)

## What to do?

- Work on creating goals and hooks with more bite. Make the players have drive beyond loot, xp, and implict consent.
  - Kill dogs
  - Steal princeses
  - Destroy cars
- Think about intel gathering and really create a good sandbox with lots of parts.
  - Not just a string of rooms.
  - Predators Camp
  - Things to interact with
  - Patterns to indentify
  - Fog of war
- Think of all the ways that things can go wrong.
  - Don't thrawt the players, just make sure that murphy's law is always in play
- Play fair
  - Kill npcs
  - Kill players
  - Don't pick a side
  - holding back ruins it for everyone

**Think**

- Predator
- Assasins creed
- Goblin outpost fight
- Ogre Cave Fight
- Dragin lair fight
- Solitario
- Metal Gear Solid
- Heists

Maybe a heist is the way to go. A series of mini missions each session to get info. Then the final climax.

- Floorplan
- Guard details
- Traps & Countermeasures
- Locks & Portals
- Disabling key systems
- Distractions
- Entrance
- Fencing
- Other
  - Don't know what it is, just the room that its kept
  - Don't know how to make it valuable
  - Put it back (C4, jewels) / replace it (art fake)
  - Assasinate

This is an interesting idea to play around with, i have content for the next session. Week after engagement I'll do a heist.
