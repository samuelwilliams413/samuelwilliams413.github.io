Wtf

I was angry when i read this this morning and my first reaction was to tell you to fuck off and say every cruel and petty thing I could think of. But I don't want to make things worse, I think I'm better off explaining myself

The short of it is:

- I'm hurt;
- it feels like you are acting self-absorbed, aren't happy for me, and that I'm not important to you;
- You are making it harder for me to trust you and you seem detached from how your actions are causing space between us; and,
- I don't know what i want you to do, i wish turning up had been what wanted to do of your own accord

I was really pissed this morning, I just wanted to go off and vent all my resentment and frustration and just be cruel. I felt/feel betrayed, and I've given myself time so I'm not responding entirely out of anger. But I'm still turning it all over in my head

Your response implies that you've already made plans for the day of the party. That those plans overlap. And that you're going to the event after (bar) rather than coming to the party late, even briefly. You say that you're going to interfere with people having a good time, that you'll dampen the mood. And there have been times where you have said that your emotional state has made you want to stay in, do nothing, and feel sad.

But you aren't doing that, you're going out to have fun with people. After spending the day with people.

Even if it were the case; I'm not a party person, but when you have asked for me to come to tomcat or to bradley's "lets get drunk" I turned up. Because it seemed important to you. The fact that it meant something to you meant that it was important to me. I guess part of what makes this hurt is that it doesn't seem reciprocal.

Your response, and your actions, seem to be completely insensitive to how you not turning up might effect me (aside from whether or not I'm worried about you.)

You've had you own shit going on, for a while now, and i think everyone has tried to be accommodating and understanding. But the reckless self immolation from when you broke up with nerida is no longer an aberration, it seems to be the new normal. Your belligerence, melancholy, negligence, impulsiveness are all becoming who you are. There was a point in time where you had "principles", or at the very least rules about yourself that you tried to follow. Things about lies, women, infidelity, keeping promises to yourself, etc... Rubicons that you hadn't and wouldn't cross. You used to be dishonest to people but tried to not outright lie. You used to treat your friends better.

But now, I know you'd hide things from smilie and I. I know you are willing to hold resentment and grudges over small things and let them fester, and hide it from us. I know that you've broken all of your rules. There's been a gap growing between us, and random night drinking isn't going to fix this. I can't depend on your character or our friendship.

I'm have been able to pretend that when we have been distant thats because it wasn't important. I have been able to tell myself that your absence has been because times are hard. I've believed that if there was something important to you I'd make the effort. And I've been telling myself that if it was something important to me that you would be there.

I don't know anymore. This has rocked me.

I've tried to interpret so much of whats been happening positively.

I don't want you to come just because I'm hurt, or because you feel guilty, or you feel you owe it to me. Its about everything, not just the party. I honestly don't know what I want to happen next. I wish we were never in this scenario.
