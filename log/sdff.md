## Should I just lock the players in?

So Gygax had this idea that there can be no menaingful campaign without timekeeping.

> “Game time is of utmost importance. Failure to keep careful track of time expenditure by player characters will result in many anomalies in the game. The stricture of time is what makes recovery of hit points meaningful. Likewise, the time spent adventuring in wilderness areas removes concerned characters from their bases of operations – be they rented chambers or battlemented strongholds. Certainly the most important time strictures pertains to the manufacturing of magic items, for during the period of such activity no adventuring can be done. Time is also considered in gaining levels and learning new languages and more. All of these demands upon game time force choices upon player characters and likewise number their days of game life…YOU CAN NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.”

I mean, I get it. If you don't have constant pressure on the party then they can move at their own pace as all resource management and restrictions become meaningless. If your resource managment is based on days (e.g. rations & spells) then having time based pressures on the players will result in resource amnagement becoming more meaningful. When you don't have time based pressures (e.g. one encounter per day) then player just blow all their spells on the encounter, rest, and then walk into the next room and repeat.

Because D&D is based on a bunch of time based resources it meant that there can be no menaingful D&D campaign without timekeeping. Thing is though, attrition isn't fun and if it isn't serving a purpose theres no reason to slowly bleed the players. I've recently spent a lot of time in sessions handling wilderness encounters and resource managment. The idea is that it isn't safe to adventure and the paryt doesn't want todally. But instead we end up spending most of our time resolving wilderness encounters, which isn't the fun part of the game.

Basically you have three choices:

1. Parties are at full resources every time they enter an encounter
1. Parties are unable to recover resource during an adventure
1. Parties are able to recover resources at some interval


### Full resources every time

- Always have nukes and mega abilities
- Always have nukes and mega abilities
- Predictable combat, use best abilities in decending order
- encounters need to be life or death, or they become meaningless
- damage becomes meaningless once combat is over

### Never Recover

- Attrition
- Encounters can't be too deadly
- No mistakes
- Resources become very meaningful





Basically, need a method of preventing them from
